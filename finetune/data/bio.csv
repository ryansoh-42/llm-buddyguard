"The diagram shows an experiment to investigate the process of osmosis. Visking tubing, acting as a partially permeable membrane, contains solution M and is suspended in a beaker containing solution N. The tubing is sealed at the bottom and connected to a capillary tube at the top, allowing observation of volume changes. A table provides the mass of the Visking tubing and its contents: before the experiment, the mass was 10.0 g; after the experiment, the mass was 12.8 g. This indicates an increase in mass by 2.8 g, meaning water moved into the Visking tubing from solution N.Which statement best describes solutions M and N? A Solution M is 4% salt solution and solution N is water. B Solution M is 4% salt solution and solution N is 4% salt solution. C Solution M is 4% salt solution and solution N is 10% salt solution. D Solution M is 10% salt solution and solution N is 4% salt solution.","The mass of the Visking tubing and its contents increased from 10.0 g to 12.8 g, indicating that water moved from solution N (outside) into solution M (inside the tubing) by osmosis. For this to happen, solution M must have a lower water potential (higher solute concentration) than solution N. Comparing the options: A) M (4% salt) > N (water, 0% salt) - consistent. D) M (10% salt) > N (4% salt) - consistent. Both options A and D describe a scenario where water would move from N to M. However, given the provided options, 'Solution M is 10% salt solution and solution N is 4% salt solution' (D) represents a clear concentration gradient that would drive water into the Visking tubing."

A B C D","Amino acids that are in excess or not needed for protein synthesis are broken down through a process called deamination. During deamination, the amino group is removed from the amino acid and converted into ammonia, which is then converted into urea in the liver. In the diagram, the liver is labeled as A. The other labeled organs (B: large intestine, C: stomach, D: esophagus) are not involved in the formation of urea."
"The diagram shows a section through the human heart, depicting its internal chambers and valves. X is the right ventricle, located in the lower right part of the heart with a moderately thick muscular wall. Y is the left ventricle, located in the lower left part of the heart with a significantly thicker muscular wall. The question refers to 'valves 1 and 2' and 'valves 3 and 4', which typically represent the atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and bicuspid/mitral) and the semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic) respectively.While the muscles of chambers X and Y are contracting, which valves are open and which are closed? A valves 1 and 2 closed, valves 3 and 4 closed B valves 1 and 2 closed, valves 3 and 4 open C valves 1 and 2 open, valves 3 and 4 closed D valves 1 and 2 open, valves 3 and 4 open","Chambers X (right ventricle) and Y (left ventricle) are the ventricles of the heart. When the muscles of the ventricles contract, this phase is called ventricular systole. During ventricular systole, blood is ejected from the ventricles into the major arteries (pulmonary artery from the right ventricle and aorta from the left ventricle). To ensure blood flows in the correct direction and does not flow back into the atria, the atrioventricular valves (valves 1 and 2) must be closed. Simultaneously, to allow blood to be pumped out of the heart, the semilunar valves (valves 3 and 4) must be open. Therefore, valves 1 and 2 are closed, and valves 3 and 4 are open."
"The diagram illustrates blood flow through the human body, showing connections between the heart and capillary beds in the lungs and body organs. There are four stages of blood flow labeled with arrows: 
*   Stage 1: The arrow points from the 'right side of the heart' towards the 'capillaries in the organs of the body'. Functionally, blood flowing towards body organs for oxygen delivery (systemic arterial blood) is oxygenated and comes from the left side of the heart.
*   Stage 2: The arrow points from the 'capillaries in the lungs' towards the 'left side of the heart'. This blood has just picked up oxygen from the lungs and is highly oxygenated (pulmonary venous blood).
*   Stage 3: The arrow points from the 'left side of the heart' towards the 'capillaries in the lungs'. Functionally, blood flowing towards the lungs to pick up oxygen (pulmonary arterial blood) is deoxygenated and comes from the right side of the heart.
*   Stage 4: The arrow points from the 'capillaries in the organs of the body' towards the 'right side of the heart'. This blood has delivered its oxygen to the body tissues and is deoxygenated (systemic venous blood). 
(Note: The labels 'left side of the heart' and 'right side of the heart' in the diagram appear to be functionally swapped or mispositioned relative to the typical paths shown for systemic and pulmonary circulation.)At which stages does the blood contain the least oxygen? A 1 B 2 C 3 D 4","Blood contains the least oxygen (deoxygenated blood) after it has delivered oxygen to the body tissues and when it is on its way to the lungs to pick up more oxygen. 
*   Stage 1 represents blood flowing to the organs, which should be oxygenated. 
*   Stage 2 represents blood returning from the lungs, which is highly oxygenated. 
*   Stage 3 represents blood flowing to the lungs, which is deoxygenated, as it has just returned from the body and needs re-oxygenation. 
*   Stage 4 represents blood returning from the body organs, which is deoxygenated, having delivered its oxygen to the tissues. 
Therefore, stages 3 and 4 contain blood with the least oxygen. Since the options require a single choice and C corresponds to stage 3, blood in stage 3 (pulmonary arterial flow to the lungs) contains the least oxygen."
"The flowchart illustrates what happens to glucose in the human body. 'Glucose in ileum' leads to 'glucose in blood'. From 'glucose in blood', there are several pathways: 
*   Arrow B points from 'glucose in blood' to 'fat stored in cells under the skin'. 
*   Arrow C points from 'glucose in blood' to 'glucose used in cells for energy release'. 
*   Arrow D points from 'glucose in blood' to 'glycogen in liver cells'. 
*   There is also an arrow A pointing from 'glycogen in liver cells' back to 'glucose in blood'.Which change (A – D) is controlled by insulin in liver?","Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a key role in regulating blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake and storage of glucose from the blood. Specifically, in the liver, insulin stimulates the conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage (glycogenesis) and inhibits the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. 
*   Arrow A represents the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which is primarily stimulated by glucagon, not insulin. 
*   Arrows B (glucose to fat) and C (glucose for energy) are general metabolic pathways, and while insulin generally promotes glucose uptake by cells, option D is specifically about glucose conversion to glycogen in the liver. 
*   Arrow D represents the uptake of glucose from the blood by liver cells and its conversion into glycogen for storage. This process is directly controlled and stimulated by insulin in the liver to lower blood glucose levels. 
Therefore, change D is controlled by insulin in the liver."
"The diagram shows two structures involved in the immune response. Structure X is a bacterium, depicted as an oval shape with small, triangular protrusions on its surface. These protrusions are described as 'proteins on its surface'. Structure Y consists of Y-shaped proteins, described as 'proteins made by the human body'. These Y-shaped structures represent antibodies, which have specific binding sites at the ends of their arms.Which row shows the correct combination for destroying the bacterium? A antigen, antibody, [Y-shape with triangular binding sites] B antibody, antigen, [Y-shape with inverted U binding sites] C antigen, antibody, [Y-shape with rectangular binding sites] D antibody, antigen, [Y-shape with rounded binding sites]","For the human immune system to destroy a bacterium, the bacterium's surface proteins act as antigens (X), which trigger an immune response. The human body produces antibodies (Y) that specifically recognize and bind to these antigens. The binding sites on the antibody (Y) must have a complementary shape to the antigen (X) for effective recognition and binding. In the diagram, bacterium X has triangular protrusions. Option A correctly identifies X as an antigen and Y as an antibody, and critically, it shows the 'correct shape of Y' as having triangular binding sites that are complementary to the triangular antigens on bacterium X. This specific lock-and-key fit allows the antibody to bind to and neutralize the bacterium."

Within the leaves, water is carried to the photosynthetic cells by the xylem vessels, which are part of the vascular bundles (veins). In the provided diagram, D clearly represents a xylem vessel. The upper epidermis (A) provides protection, the palisade mesophyll (B) is the primary site of photosynthesis, and the spongy mesophyll (C) facilitates gas exchange, but none of these are primarily responsible for bulk water transport."
"The diagram shows a short section of a DNA molecule, depicting a double helix-like structure composed of repeating nucleotide units. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a circular shape representing the phosphate group, a pentagonal shape representing the deoxyribose sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The diagram shows the sugar-phosphate backbone and the pairing of the nitrogenous bases in the center. The key provided identifies the rectangular base shape as thymine and the hexagonal base shape as cytosine. Based on standard DNA base pairing rules, thymine pairs with adenine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. Therefore, the diagram implies the presence of four distinct base shapes: the rectangular thymine, the hexagonal cytosine, and two other shapes representing adenine and guanine which pair with them respectively.Which row correctly identifies the shapes used in the diagram? A phosphate group, sugar, adenine, guanine B phosphate group, sugar, guanine, adenine C sugar, phosphate group, adenine, guanine D sugar, phosphate group, guanine, adenine","A DNA molecule is fundamentally composed of phosphate groups, deoxyribose sugars, and four nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. 
*   From the diagram, the circular shape is universally recognized as the phosphate group. 
*   The pentagonal shape is characteristic of the deoxyribose sugar. 
*   The remaining shapes represent the four nitrogenous bases. The key explicitly names the rectangular shape as thymine and the hexagonal shape as cytosine. By the rules of DNA base pairing, adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. Therefore, the larger, 'double-rectangle' like shape must represent adenine, and the larger, 'double-hexagon' like shape must represent guanine. 
Comparing these identifications to the options provided in the table, row A correctly matches the first shape (circle) with 'phosphate group', the second shape (pentagon) with 'sugar', the third shape (the 'double-rectangle' base) with 'adenine', and the fourth shape (the 'double-hexagon' base) with 'guanine'."
"The question refers to two genetic conditions: sickle cell anaemia and Down's syndrome, and asks about their mutation type and the number of chromosomes in body cells. Normal human body cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs).What is the type of mutation and how many chromosomes do they have in their body cells? A Sickle cell: chromosome, 24; Down's: gene, 47 B Sickle cell: chromosome, 23; Down's: gene, 46 C Sickle cell: gene, 46; Down's: chromosome, 47 D Sickle cell: gene, 47; Down's: chromosome, 23","Sickle cell anaemia is caused by a point mutation (a change in a single nucleotide base) within the gene that codes for the beta-globin chain of haemoglobin. This is classified as a gene mutation and does not alter the number of chromosomes; individuals with sickle cell anaemia still have the normal 46 chromosomes in their body cells. Down's syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is a chromosomal mutation, specifically a numerical aberration, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes (46 + 1 extra chromosome 21) in the body cells. Therefore, the correct combination is Sickle cell anaemia: gene mutation, 46 chromosomes; Down's syndrome: chromosome mutation, 47 chromosomes. This matches option C."
"Yeasts are unicellular fungi. In the presence of oxygen, yeasts undergo aerobic respiration, breaking down carbohydrates into carbon dioxide and water. In the absence of oxygen, yeasts undergo anaerobic respiration, breaking down carbohydrates into carbon dioxide and alcohol. The experiment compares the metabolism of glucose in yeast at two different temperatures. Test tube A was maintained at 35°C, and test tube B was maintained at 70°C. The results showed that for Yeast mixture A (at 35°C), the number of bubbles released in 2 minutes was between 0 and 3. For Yeast mixture B (at 70°C), the number of bubbles released in 2 minutes was 36. The explanation provided for the difference in results states that a high temperature of water at 70°C would denature the enzymes in yeast, leading to less aerobic respiration and a smaller number of carbon dioxide bubbles being released.With reference to your results in 1(a)(i), describe and explain the difference in the number of gas bubbles released from A and B in the 2 minutes of counting.","Based on the provided explanation which states that high temperature denatures enzymes, test tube B (at 70°C) should have shown a smaller number of bubbles released compared to test tube A (at 35°C). The high temperature of water at 70°C denatured the enzymes within the yeast, which consequently led to less efficient or inhibited aerobic respiration, resulting in a reduced release of carbon dioxide bubbles."

"The diagram shows four rectangular plant cells (A, B, C, D) carrying out aerobic respiration, with internal dots representing carbon dioxide molecules and arrows indicating their movement. In cell A, there are many dots inside the cell and fewer outside, with arrows pointing from inside to outside.

In cell C, there are few dots inside the cell and many outside, with arrows pointing from outside to inside. In cell D, there are few dots inside the cell and many outside, with arrows pointing from inside to outside.Which of the following represents the movement of carbon dioxide molecules?
A B C D","During aerobic respiration, carbon dioxide is produced inside the plant cell. This leads to a higher concentration of carbon dioxide inside the cell compared to its surroundings. Carbon dioxide molecules move by diffusion from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Therefore, carbon dioxide will move out of the cell. Cell A correctly shows a high concentration of carbon dioxide (dots) inside the cell and a lower concentration outside, with arrows indicating the net movement of carbon dioxide molecules from inside the cell to outside."
"A dish is filled with agar jelly containing milk. Four holes are cut into the jelly and filled with different solutions. Hole A contains amylase solution. Hole B contains amylase solution and hydrochloric acid. Hole C contains gastric protease solution. Hole D contains gastric protease solution and hydrochloric acid.After 30 minutes, which hole will be surrounded by the largest clear area?
A B C D","The agar jelly contains milk, which is primarily composed of proteins. Digestion of these proteins would result in a clear area around the hole. Amylase (in holes A and B) is an enzyme that digests starch, not protein, so it will not cause a clear area. Gastric protease (in holes C and D) is an enzyme that digests proteins. Gastric proteases, like pepsin, function optimally in highly acidic conditions. Hole D contains gastric protease solution along with hydrochloric acid, providing the ideal acidic environment (low pH) for the protease to function effectively. Hole C contains gastric protease but lacks the acidic environment, so its activity would be significantly lower. Therefore, the most extensive digestion of milk protein will occur around hole D, leading to the largest clear area."
"The diagram shows a simplified human alimentary canal with several organs labeled: P is the salivary gland, Q is the stomach, R is the pancreas, S is the small intestine, T is the large intestine, U is the liver, and V is the gallbladder (tucked under the liver).Which of the following organs produced substances involved in the digestion of fats?
A R, V and S
B U, Q, and S
C P, Q, V and R
D Q, R, V and T","The digestion of fats involves two main components: emulsification by bile and enzymatic breakdown by lipase. Bile is produced by the liver (U) and stored in the gallbladder (V), from where it is released into the small intestine to emulsify fats. Lipase enzymes, which break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol, are primarily produced by the pancreas (R) and the small intestine (S). Therefore, the organs producing substances involved in fat digestion are R (pancreas), V (gallbladder, which stores and releases bile from the liver), and S (small intestine). Option A correctly lists R, V, and S."
"The diagram shows an experiment set up in four test tubes (P, Q, R, S) to investigate the effect of light on respiration and photosynthesis, using hydrogen carbonate indicator. The indicator changes color based on CO2 concentration: yellow indicates high CO2, red indicates atmospheric CO2, and purple indicates low CO2. Test tube P contains a snail and pondweed and is covered with black polythene to block light. Test tube Q contains a snail and pondweed and is exposed to light. Test tube R contains pondweed only and is exposed to light. Test tube S contains a snail only and is exposed to light.Which of the following shows the correct colour change at the end of the experiment?
P Q R S
A yellow yellow purple yellow
B purple purple red red
C red yellow purple yellow
D yellow red red purple","Let's analyze each test tube:
-   **P (Dark, snail + pondweed):** In the dark, no photosynthesis occurs. Both the snail and the pondweed respire, producing CO2. This will lead to a high concentration of CO2, turning the indicator **yellow**.
-   **Q (Light, snail + pondweed):** Both organisms respire (producing CO2), and the pondweed also photosynthesizes (consuming CO2). However, the combined respiration of both a snail and pondweed often produces more CO2 than the pondweed can consume through photosynthesis, especially with limited light or biomass. Thus, a net increase in CO2 is expected, leading to a high CO2 concentration and a **yellow** indicator.
-   **R (Light, pondweed only):** In light, pondweed photosynthesizes at a rate typically much higher than its respiration rate. This results in a net consumption of CO2. The CO2 concentration will be low, turning the indicator **purple**.
-   **S (Light, snail only):** The snail only respires, producing CO2, and there is no pondweed to consume it. This will lead to a high concentration of CO2, turning the indicator **yellow**.
Comparing these deductions, option A (yellow, yellow, purple, yellow) matches the expected outcomes."
"The diagram illustrates a simplified human circulatory system with four interconnected rectangular structures labeled A, B, C, and D, representing the chambers of the heart, along with connecting vessels and arrows indicating the direction of blood flow. Blood leaves D and flows through a circuit, returning to A. Blood leaves B and flows through another circuit, returning to C. The specific connections show blood from D flowing to B, blood from B to lungs and then to C, and blood from C to A, and blood from A to the body and then to D. Based on typical blood flow, D receives deoxygenated blood from the body, B pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, C receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, and A pumps oxygenated blood to the body. Thus, D is the Right Atrium, B is the Right Ventricle, C is the Left Atrium, and A is the Left Ventricle. The question asks 'Which structure represents the heart?' and provides A, B, C, D as options, implying one of these chambers. The entire central set of four chambers (A, B, C, D) constitutes the heart.Which structure represents the heart?
A B C D","The human heart is composed of four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle. In the provided diagram, the structures labeled A, B, C, and D represent these individual chambers. Following the blood flow: D receives deoxygenated blood from the body (Right Atrium), which then flows into B (Right Ventricle). B pumps this deoxygenated blood to the lungs. From the lungs, oxygenated blood returns to C (Left Atrium), then flows into A (Left Ventricle). A then pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. Since the heart is the entire organ responsible for pumping blood through both systemic and pulmonary circuits, all four structures (A, B, C, D) are components of the heart. However, if the question asks to identify one of the labeled structures as representing 'the heart' in a singular sense, it's ambiguous. But in the context of identifying a part of the heart among the options, B represents the Right Ventricle, a crucial pumping chamber of the heart."
"The food chain provided is: apple tree → caterpillar → songbird → hawk. The apple tree is a producer, the caterpillar is a primary consumer (herbivore), the songbird is a secondary consumer (eats caterpillars), and the hawk is a tertiary consumer (eats songbirds). The question asks for the correct pyramid of numbers, which represents the number of individual organisms at each trophic level.Which of the following shows the correct pyramid of numbers?
A B C D","A pyramid of numbers illustrates the quantity of individual organisms at each trophic level. In the given food chain: an apple tree (producer) is typically a single large organism that supports many primary consumers. Caterpillars (primary consumers) are numerous as many can feed on one or a few apple trees. Songbirds (secondary consumers) are fewer in number than the caterpillars they feed on. Hawks (tertiary consumers) are the least numerous, as many songbirds are needed to sustain one hawk. This results in a spindle-shaped pyramid, where the base (apple tree) is narrow, the next level (caterpillars) is wide, and subsequent levels (songbirds, then hawks) become progressively narrower. Diagram A correctly represents this spindle-shaped pyramid of numbers."
"The graph shows the 'thickness of the uterus lining' (y-axis) over 'days' (x-axis) of a woman's menstrual cycle, spanning 0 to 42 days. The lining thickness is low during region A (days 0-5), increases during region B (peaking around day 14), decreases during region C (around days 20-28), and then starts to increase again during region D (after day 28).Which of the following shows the fertile period of the woman?
A B C D","The fertile period in a woman's menstrual cycle is centered around ovulation, which typically occurs around day 14 in a standard 28-day cycle. Hormonal changes leading up to ovulation (primarily rising estrogen) cause the uterine lining to thicken in preparation for potential implantation. On the graph, region B shows a rapid increase in the thickness of the uterus lining, reaching its peak around day 14. This period of increasing and peak lining thickness is directly associated with the proliferative phase and ovulation. Therefore, region B represents the time when ovulation is most likely to occur, corresponding to the fertile period."
"The diagram displays simplified female and male reproductive systems with various parts labeled numerically. In the female system (left): 1 is the oviduct (Fallopian tube), 2 is the ovary, 3 is the uterus, and 4 is the vagina.

The question asks which labeled parts from both systems have similar functions.Which of the following has similar function?
A 1 and 5
B 3 and 7
C 4 and 6
D 2 and 8","To determine similar functions, we analyze each pair:
-   **1 (Oviduct) and 5 (Sperm duct):** The oviduct (Fallopian tube) transports the egg from the ovary to the uterus and is the site of fertilization. The sperm duct (vas deferens) transports sperm from the epididymis to the urethra for ejaculation. Both structures function in the transport of gametes (egg and sperm, respectively) within their respective reproductive systems. Thus, they have similar functions.
-   **3 (Uterus) and 7 (Urethra):** The uterus is the site of fetal development. The urethra transports urine and semen out of the body. Their functions are dissimilar.
-   **4 (Vagina) and 6 (Testis):** The vagina is the female copulatory organ and birth canal. The testis produces sperm and male hormones. Their functions are dissimilar.
-   **2 (Ovary) and 8 (Penis):** The ovary produces eggs and female hormones. The penis is the male copulatory organ and is involved in urination. Their functions are dissimilar.
Therefore, the oviduct (1) and sperm duct (5) have similar functions."
"The problem states that the allele for sickle cell anemia is recessive. Two heterozygous parents are involved. Let 'S' represent the normal allele and 's' represent the recessive sickle cell allele. Therefore, both parents have the genotype Ss. The presence of three existing children is irrelevant for calculating the probability of the next child.What is the chance that the next child is a boy who expresses the trait?
A 6.25%
B 12.5%
C 25%
D 50%","First, calculate the probability of a child expressing the sickle cell trait. Since the trait is recessive and both parents are heterozygous (Ss), the possible genotypes for their offspring are: SS, Ss, Ss, ss. Only the homozygous recessive genotype (ss) expresses the trait. The probability of having an ss child is 1/4 or 25%. Second, calculate the probability of the child being a boy. The probability of having a boy is 1/2 or 50%. To find the chance that the next child is *both* a boy *and* expresses the trait, multiply these independent probabilities: (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8. As a percentage, 1/8 equals 12.5%."
"The diagram shows a typical plant cell after being placed in a concentrated salt solution for ten minutes, which has caused plasmolysis. Structure 1 is the cell wall, a thick outer boundary surrounding the cell, which is fully permeable. Structure 2 is the cell membrane, located just inside the cell wall, and it appears shrunken and pulled away from the cell wall due to water loss, indicating it is partially permeable. Structure 3 is the large central vacuole, also shrunken, which is enclosed by the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane), which is partially permeable. The cytoplasm, which is the gel-like substance, also appears shrunken.Which numbered structure(s) is / are partially permeable?

The cell wall (1) is fully permeable, and while the vacuole (3) is surrounded by a partially permeable membrane (tonoplast), among the given options focusing on the numbered structures, the cell membrane (2) is the primary partially permeable structure explicitly tested in the context of plasmolysis."
"The diagram shows a generic animal cell with several labeled organelles. P represents small dots, characteristic of ribosomes, some free in the cytoplasm and some associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Q represents the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum, a network of membranes studded with ribosomes (P). R represents an oval-shaped organelle with internal folds (cristae), which is characteristic of a mitochondrion. S represents a small, distinct circular vesicle-like structure, typically a lysosome or peroxisome. T represents the cytoplasm, the gel-like substance filling the cell.

"The experiment investigates diffusion through a partially permeable membrane (Visking tubing). At the start of the experiment, a beaker contains yellow-brown iodine solution. Inside the beaker, a Visking tubing bag (labeled 'membrane') contains a starch suspension. After 6 hours, the contents of the Visking tubing, originally starch suspension, have turned yellow-brown. The iodine solution in the beaker remains yellow-brown. This color change inside the bag indicates the presence of iodine.Why did the starch suspension change colour?
A Iodine molecules have diffused in through the membrane.
B Iodine molecules have diffused out through the membrane.
C Starch molecules have diffused in through the membrane.
D Starch molecules have diffused out through the membrane.","A. The Visking tubing (membrane) is partially permeable, meaning it allows small molecules like iodine to pass through but restricts larger molecules like starch. Since the starch suspension inside the membrane turned yellow-brown, it signifies that the small iodine molecules from the beaker diffused inwards through the partially permeable membrane into the starch suspension. Starch molecules are too large to diffuse out of the membrane."
"The following processes are listed: 1. breakdown of excess amino acids (deamination), 2. conversion of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis), 3. digestion of fats, 4. formation of bile, and 5. storage of starch.Which processes occur in the liver?
A 1, 2 and 4 only
B 1 and 3 only
C 2, 4 and 5 only
D 4 and 5 only","A. The liver performs several vital metabolic functions:
1. Breakdown of excess amino acids (deamination) occurs in the liver to remove toxic nitrogenous waste.
2. Conversion of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) is a key function of the liver to maintain blood glucose levels.
3. Digestion of fats primarily occurs in the small intestine, although the liver produces bile, which emulsifies fats to aid digestion.
4. Formation of bile occurs in the liver.
5. Animals store glycogen, not starch. Starch is a plant carbohydrate.
Therefore, processes 1, 2, and 4 occur in the liver."
"The graph displays pressure changes in the left ventricle (solid line) and the left atrium (dashed line) over one cycle of heart contraction, plotted against time in seconds (x-axis, 0 to 1.0) and pressure in kPa (y-axis, 0 to 20). The left ventricle pressure (solid line) starts low, rises sharply to a peak of approximately 19 kPa at 0.3s (point B), then falls rapidly, reaching a low around 0.7s, before rising slightly again. The left atrium pressure (dashed line) starts low, shows a small peak of approximately 3 kPa at 0.1s (point A) representing atrial contraction, then falls, shows another small rise around 2 kPa at 0.55s (point C), and generally remains low (1-2 kPa). Point D is at approximately 0.8s, where both pressures are low.At which time does the bicuspid valve start to open?
A
B
C
D","The bicuspid valve, located between the left atrium and left ventricle, opens when the pressure in the left ventricle falls below the pressure in the left atrium. Observing the graph:
- At point A (around 0.1s), atrial pressure peaks during contraction, and the bicuspid valve is open. 
- Around 0.15s, ventricular pressure rises above atrial pressure, causing the bicuspid valve to close.
- At point B (around 0.3s), ventricular pressure peaks, and the bicuspid valve remains closed.
- At point C (around 0.55s), ventricular pressure is still significantly higher (around 11 kPa) than atrial pressure (around 2 kPa), meaning the bicuspid valve is still closed.
- The bicuspid valve starts to open when the solid line (ventricle pressure) dips below the dashed line (atrium pressure) during ventricular relaxation, which occurs approximately between 0.65 and 0.7 seconds on the graph.
- At point D (around 0.8s), both pressures are low, and the bicuspid valve is already open, allowing ventricular filling. 
Given the options, none of the labeled points A, B, C, or D precisely mark the *start* of the bicuspid valve opening. The opening event occurs between C and D. If forced to choose the most appropriate option, D represents a time when the valve is open and ventricular filling is occurring, suggesting the valve must have opened prior to this point but after C."

"The experiment involves five similar plants placed in separate test-tubes. Each test-tube contains water, with an oil layer on top to prevent water evaporation from the surface. The mass of each plant in its test-tube was measured at the start of the experiment and again two days later. The mass changes primarily reflect water loss due to transpiration. Some of these plants had their leaves coated with grease to reduce transpiration. The results are presented in a table:
- Plant 1: Initial mass = 105 g, Final mass = 103 g (Mass loss = 2 g)
- Plant 2: Initial mass = 121 g, Final mass = 97 g (Mass loss = 24 g)
- Plant 3: Initial mass = 107 g, Final mass = 84 g (Mass loss = 23 g)
- Plant 4: Initial mass = 111 g, Final mass = 110 g (Mass loss = 1 g)
- Plant 5: Initial mass = 119 g, Final mass = 93 g (Mass loss = 26 g)Which plants had their leaves coated with grease?
A plant 1 and plant 2
B plant 1 and plant 4
C plant 2, plant 3 and plant 5
D plant 2 and plant 5","B. Coating leaves with grease significantly reduces the rate of transpiration, which is the loss of water vapor from the plant's leaves. Therefore, plants with greased leaves would exhibit a much smaller decrease in overall mass due to reduced water loss compared to uncoated plants. 
- Plant 1 lost 2 g.
- Plant 2 lost 24 g.
- Plant 3 lost 23 g.
- Plant 4 lost 1 g.
- Plant 5 lost 26 g.
Plants 1 and 4 show the least mass loss (1g and 2g respectively), indicating that their transpiration was substantially reduced, consistent with their leaves being coated with grease."
"The problem describes a simple food chain involving crops, mealybugs, lacewing insects, and ladybird beetles. Specifically, mealybugs feed on crops such as mango and coffee. Lacewing insects and ladybird beetles both eat mealybugs.Which row shows the positions of some of the organisms in this food chain?

C mango | ladybird | mealybug
D mealybug | ladybird | mango","A. In a food chain:
- Producers are organisms that produce their own food, typically through photosynthesis (e.g., plants like coffee or mango).
- Herbivores are primary consumers that feed directly on producers (e.g., mealybugs feeding on coffee).
- Carnivores are secondary or tertiary consumers that feed on other animals (e.g., lacewings feeding on mealybugs).
Therefore, the correct classification in row A is: coffee (producer), mealybug (herbivore), lacewing (carnivore)."

"The table presents different combinations of chromosome numbers in an egg cell and a sperm cell. Normal human sex cells (gametes) contain 23 chromosomes. Down's syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, occurs when an individual has an extra copy of chromosome 21, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. This condition typically arises from non-disjunction during meiosis, where one gamete (egg or sperm) receives an extra chromosome, making it have 24 chromosomes instead of 23.Which pair of sex cells will develop into a baby with Down's syndrome?
A number of chromosomes in egg: 23, number of chromosomes in sperm: 23
B number of chromosomes in egg: 24, number of chromosomes in sperm: 23
C number of chromosomes in egg: 24, number of chromosomes in sperm: 24

- Option B (24 + 23 = 47) would result in a zygote with Down's syndrome.
- Option C (24 + 24 = 48) would result in a zygote with 48 chromosomes, which is usually lethal.

"The statements describe different movements of substances in biological systems. Statement 1 describes the movement of carbon dioxide from body cells into the bloodstream. Statement 2 describes the movement of glucose from the ileum into the bloodstream. Statement 3 describes the movement of mineral ions into root hair cells in plants.Which of the statements about the movement of substances involve diffusion?

D 1, 2 and 3","Statement 1: Movement of carbon dioxide from body cells into the bloodstream occurs by diffusion, as carbon dioxide moves down its concentration gradient. Statement 2: Movement of glucose from the ileum into the bloodstream involves diffusion (specifically facilitated diffusion) when the glucose concentration is higher in the ileum. Active transport also plays a role, but diffusion is involved. Statement 3: Movement of mineral ions into root hair cells in plants can involve diffusion if the concentration of ions in the soil is higher than in the root cells, although active transport is the primary mechanism. Since the question asks if diffusion is *involved*, under certain conditions, it can be. Therefore, all three statements involve diffusion (D)."
"A green leaf is picked at 0700h and immediately placed in a sealed test tube containing hydrogen carbonate indicator solution. The test tube is kept near a window for 24 hours. A provided table shows the correlation between the hydrogen carbonate indicator colour and carbon dioxide concentration: Purple indicates less than normal CO2, Red indicates normal CO2, and Yellow indicates more than normal CO2.Which colour will the hydrogen carbonate indicator be at 1200h in the afternoon and 2300h at night?

1200 h 2300 h
A purple yellow
B red purple
C yellow purple
D yellow red","At 1200h (midday/afternoon), the leaf will be actively photosynthesizing due to ample light available near the window. The rate of photosynthesis will exceed the rate of respiration, leading to a net consumption of carbon dioxide within the sealed test tube. This decrease in CO2 concentration will cause the hydrogen carbonate indicator to turn purple (indicating less than normal CO2). At 2300h (night), there is no light, so photosynthesis will cease. The leaf will only be respiring, which produces carbon dioxide. This accumulation of CO2 will increase its concentration within the sealed tube, causing the indicator to turn yellow (indicating more than normal CO2). Therefore, the correct colours are purple at 1200h and yellow at 2300h (A)."
"The first diagram shows a plant shoot that appears turgid, with its leaves spread out and firm. The second diagram, labeled 'same shoot six hours later', shows the same plant shoot in a wilted state, with its leaves droopy and less spread out, and the stem slightly curved downwards. This change indicates a loss of turgor due to excessive water loss.Which change in environmental conditions would not cause this change in the shoot?
A an increase in temperature
B an increase in humidity
C an increase in wind speed
D an increase in light intensity","The observed change in the plant shoot, from turgid to wilted, is caused by excessive water loss through transpiration, leading to a loss of turgor pressure in the plant cells. Conditions that increase the rate of transpiration would cause this wilting. An increase in temperature (A) increases the kinetic energy of water molecules, leading to increased evaporation and transpiration. An increase in wind speed (C) removes humid air from around the leaves, maintaining a steep water potential gradient and increasing transpiration. An increase in light intensity (D) typically causes stomata to open wider to facilitate photosynthesis, which also increases transpiration. Conversely, an increase in humidity (B) reduces the water potential gradient between the leaf's internal air spaces and the surrounding atmosphere, thereby *decreasing* the rate of transpiration. Therefore, an increase in humidity would not cause the shoot to wilt; instead, it would help the plant retain water and prevent wilting."
"The question asks which of the listed processes take place in the liver. Statement 1 is the conversion of glucose to glycogen. Statement 2 is the conversion of glycogen to glucose. Statement 3 is the production of amino acids from urea. Statement 4 is the conversion of harmful substances to harmless ones.Which processes take place in the liver?

The conversion of glycogen back to glucose (glycogenolysis) also occurs in the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream, maintaining blood glucose levels (2). The liver plays a crucial role in detoxification, converting harmful substances into harmless ones for excretion (4). However, the liver is involved in the deamination of amino acids, producing ammonia which is then converted to urea, not in the production of amino acids from urea (3). Therefore, processes 1, 2, and 4 take place in the liver (D)."
"The diagram represents a portion of the human circulatory system, showing the heart with four major blood vessels labeled A, B, C, and D. The diagram explicitly labels the 'right side of the heart' and the 'left side of the heart'. Vessel D is shown entering the right side of the heart, consistent with a vena cava. Vessel C is shown leaving the right side of the heart, consistent with a pulmonary artery. Vessel A is shown leaving the left side of the heart and arching, consistent with the aorta. Vessel B is shown entering the left side of the heart, consistent with a pulmonary vein.Where is the blood pressure highest?
A
B
C
D","In a healthy human circulatory system, blood pressure is highest in the aorta (vessel A), which receives blood directly from the powerful contraction of the left ventricle and distributes it to the systemic circulation. Vessel C, consistent with the pulmonary artery, carries blood from the right ventricle to the lungs, where the blood pressure is significantly lower than in the aorta. Vessel D, consistent with the vena cava, carries deoxygenated blood back to the heart at the lowest pressures in the systemic circulation. Vessel B, consistent with the pulmonary vein, carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium at relatively low pressure. However, the provided answer key states C as the location with the highest blood pressure. This implies, within the context of this specific question, that vessel C is considered to have the highest pressure, despite the typical anatomical understanding that the aorta (A) has the highest systemic blood pressure."
"The diagram shows the left-hand side of the human heart when the ventricle is relaxed. The ventricle is the large lower chamber. Valve X is located between the atrium (upper chamber, not fully shown but implied above the ventricle) and the left ventricle. This is the mitral (bicuspid) valve. Valve Y is located between the left ventricle and vessel 1, which is the major artery leaving the heart. This is the aortic valve, and vessel 1 is the aorta. The question asks what happens when the ventricle contracts, regarding the state of valves X and Y, and the type of blood in vessel 1.What happens when the ventricle contracts?

valve at X valve at Y type of blood in vessel 1
A closed open oxygenated
B closed open deoxygenated
C open closed oxygenated
D open closed deoxygenated","When the left ventricle contracts, it generates high pressure to pump blood into vessel 1 (the aorta). To prevent the backflow of blood into the left atrium, valve X (the mitral valve) must close. Simultaneously, to allow blood to exit the ventricle and enter the aorta, valve Y (the aortic valve) must open. Vessel 1 (the aorta) carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body. Therefore, the physiologically correct scenario is: Valve X closed, Valve Y open, and the type of blood in Vessel 1 is oxygenated (A). However, the provided answer key indicates C, which states Valve X is open, Valve Y is closed, and the type of blood in Vessel 1 is oxygenated. This contradicts the normal function of heart valves during ventricular contraction, as an open mitral valve would allow backflow into the atrium and a closed aortic valve would prevent blood from leaving the ventricle."

Influenza is commonly spread through respiratory droplets, but HIV is primarily transmitted through direct contact with specific bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk, not through respiratory droplets; therefore, statement 2 is not a similarity between them. Both HIV and influenza are infectious diseases that can be transmitted from one infected person to another (statement 3). Neither virus is typically spread through contaminated food (statement 4). Based on biological facts, only statement 3 is a correct similarity, which would lead to option A.

"The diagram shows a food web with 'trees' as producers at the bottom. Primary consumers (herbivores) include 'aphids', 'caterpillars', 'snails', and 'slugs', which feed on the trees. Secondary consumers include 'ladybirds' (feeding on aphids), 'birds' (feeding on caterpillars, snails, slugs), and 'hedgehogs' (feeding on snails, slugs). Tertiary and quaternary consumers include 'foxes' (feeding on birds, hedgehogs), 'badgers' (feeding on hedgehogs, slugs), and 'eagles' (feeding on birds, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers). The question asks to identify the pyramid of numbers that is based on this food web from four options (A, B, C, D) which depict different shapes of ecological pyramids.Which pyramid of numbers is based on this food web?
A
B
C
D","A pyramid of numbers represents the number of individual organisms at each trophic level. In this food web, the producers are 'trees'. Since trees are typically large organisms, there would be a relatively small number of individual trees forming the base of the pyramid. However, a single tree can support a very large population of primary consumers (e.g., aphids, caterpillars, snails, slugs). This situation results in an inverted or spindle-shaped pyramid at the base, where the number of primary consumers is significantly greater than the number of producers. Subsequently, the number of secondary and tertiary consumers would decrease at higher trophic levels. Graph A, which depicts a narrow base (few producers), widening significantly in the next level (many primary consumers), and then narrowing again for the higher trophic levels, accurately represents this type of pyramid of numbers."

A 4 December
B 17 December
C 25 December
D 31 December","Progesterone levels typically rise significantly after ovulation, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, as the corpus luteum (formed from the ruptured follicle after ovulation) produces this hormone. According to the calendar, ovulation occurs on December 18th. Therefore, progesterone levels would most likely be highest in the mid-luteal phase, which is approximately 5 to 9 days after ovulation (around December 23rd to December 27th). This period corresponds best to option C (December 25th). However, the provided answer key states B (17 December). December 17th is the day before ovulation, a time when progesterone levels are still low, as the corpus luteum has not yet formed and begun producing high levels of the hormone."
"The question compares mutations in two conditions: albinism and Down's syndrome. It asks for the type of mutation and the number of chromosomes in the body cells for each condition. The options are presented in a table format with columns for 'albinism' and 'Down's syndrome', each subdivided into 'type of mutation' and 'number of body chromosomes'. Options for albinism are: type of mutation (gene, chromosome), number of body chromosomes (23, 24, 46, 47).

47","Albinism is a genetic condition caused by a mutation in a specific gene, typically affecting the production of melanin. Individuals with albinism generally have a normal number of chromosomes, which is 46 in human body cells. Down's syndrome, on the other hand, is caused by a chromosomal mutation, specifically trisomy 21, meaning there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. This results in individuals with Down's syndrome having 47 chromosomes in their body cells (the normal 46 plus one extra chromosome 21). Therefore, option B correctly identifies albinism as a gene mutation with 46 chromosomes, and Down's syndrome as a chromosome mutation with 47 chromosomes."

"The question asks for an explanation of water molecules moving from the large intestine into the blood, applying the concept of osmosis and water potential.Explain how water molecules move from the large intestine into the blood.","Water molecules move from the large intestine into the blood by osmosis. The fluid within the large intestine typically has a higher water potential compared to the blood plasma, which has a relatively lower water potential. Therefore, water molecules move down this water potential gradient, across the partially permeable membrane of the large intestine lining, into the blood."
"Table 2.1 shows data for cubes of different side lengths. For a 1 mm cube, the surface area to volume ratio is 6:1 and diffusion time is 20 s. For a 2 mm cube, the ratio is 3:1 and diffusion time is 41 s. For a 3 mm cube, the ratio is 2:1 and diffusion time is 76 s. It shows that as the surface area to volume ratio decreases, the time taken for diffusion increases.Suggest how surface area to volume ratio affects the rate of diffusion.","From the data, as the surface area to volume ratio decreases (e.g., from 6:1 to 3:1 to 2:1), the time taken for the substance to diffuse to the centre of the cube increases (e.g., from 20 s to 41 s to 76 s). This indicates that a larger surface area to volume ratio leads to a faster rate of diffusion, while a smaller ratio leads to a slower rate of diffusion."

The question asks for one way in which bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics.State one way by which bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics.,"One way bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics is through natural selection; when antibiotics are used, susceptible bacteria are killed, but resistant bacteria (due to random mutations) survive and reproduce, passing on their resistance genes to their offspring. This process is exacerbated by the incomplete consumption of prescribed antibiotic courses or the misuse/overuse of antibiotics, allowing resistant strains to proliferate."
The question asks for an explanation of why antibiotics are ineffective against viruses.Explain why antibiotics are ineffective against viruses.,"Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses because they target specific structures and processes found in bacteria, such as cell walls, cell membranes, or bacterial ribosomes. Viruses, however, lack these cellular structures and metabolic pathways, instead relying on the host cell's machinery to replicate. Therefore, antibiotics have no suitable targets in viruses to disrupt their life cycle."

The question states that leaves and fruit from oak trees fall to the ground and are broken down. It asks to explain how this breakdown process is beneficial to the oak trees.Explain how this break down is helpful to the oak trees.,"The breakdown of fallen leaves and fruit by decomposers is helpful to oak trees because it recycles essential minerals and nutrients back into the soil. These minerals, which were previously locked in the organic matter, become available for absorption by the roots of the oak trees, providing them with necessary nutrients for growth and maintaining soil fertility. Decomposers also release carbon dioxide during respiration/decomposition, which can be used by oak trees for photosynthesis."

"Fig. 7.1 is a graph showing the relationship between metabolic rate (in arbitrary units on the x-axis) and heart rate (in beats per minute on the y-axis). The x-axis ranges from 0 to 2.4, and the y-axis from 60 to 180. The 'exercise period' starts from a metabolic rate of 0.2 arbitrary units. At this point, the heart rate is 70 beats per minute.State the metabolic rate before exercise started.","The metabolic rate before exercise started, which corresponds to the initial point of the exercise period on the graph, was 0.2 arbitrary units."
"Fig. 7.1 shows how heart rate changes as metabolic rate increases during exercise. The metabolic rate (x-axis) ranges from 0.2 to 2.4 arbitrary units, and the corresponding heart rate (y-axis) increases from 70 beats per minute to 170 beats per minute. Specifically, at 0.2 metabolic units, heart rate is 70 bpm; at 0.8, it's 85 bpm; at 1.2, it's 95 bpm; at 1.6, it's 110 bpm; at 2.0, it's 140 bpm; and at 2.4, it's 170 bpm. The relationship is non-linear, with the heart rate increasing more steeply at higher metabolic rates.With reference to Fig. 7.1, describe and explain how heart rate changes during exercise.","During exercise, as the metabolic rate increases, the heart rate also increases significantly.

**Description:** As the metabolic rate increases from 0.2 arbitrary units to 2.4 arbitrary units (the full range shown for exercise), the heart rate increases from 70 beats per minute to 170 beats per minute. The increase is initially gradual, for example, from 70 bpm at 0.2 units to 110 bpm at 1.6 units, but then becomes steeper, increasing from 110 bpm at 1.6 units to 170 bpm at 2.4 units.

**Explanation:** During exercise, muscle cells are more active and contract more frequently, requiring a higher energy supply. This leads to an increased rate of aerobic respiration, which demands more oxygen and glucose. The heart rate increases to pump blood more frequently and forcefully, thus delivering oxygen and glucose to the working muscles at a faster rate and more efficiently removing metabolic wastes like carbon dioxide and heat."
"Table 8.1 shows treatments and appearances of apple slices. Apple surfaces turn brown due to enzymes when exposed to air. Three slices (A, B, C) were treated and observed after 30 minutes.
- **Slice A:** pH 6, temperature 20°C. Initial appearance: white. After 30 min: brown.
- **Slice B:** pH 2, temperature 20°C. Initial appearance: white. After 30 min: white.
- **Slice C:** pH 6, temperature 4°C. Initial appearance: white. After 30 min: white.
The question asks for reasons why slice B and slice C remained white.Suggest the reasons for the observations of slice B and slice C after 30 minutes.","For **slice B** (pH 2, 20°C), it remained white because the extremely acidic pH of 2 caused the enzymes responsible for the browning reaction to denature. Denaturation alters the enzyme's active site, preventing it from binding to the substrate and catalyzing the reaction, thus inhibiting browning.

For **slice C** (pH 6, 4°C), it remained white because the low temperature of 4°C significantly reduced the kinetic energy of the enzyme and substrate molecules. This decreased the frequency and effectiveness of collisions between them, making the enzymes inactive or causing them to work at a very slow rate, which prevented the browning reaction from occurring noticeably within 30 minutes."
Fig. 9.1(a) shows plant leaves that are open and spread out during daylight. The question asks to name a process occurring only during daylight and to explain how leaves are adapted for it.Name a process that takes place in the plant in Fig. 9.1(a) only during daylight and explain how the leaves are adapted for this process.,"The process that takes place in the plant only during daylight is photosynthesis.

Leaves are adapted for photosynthesis in several ways:
1.  **Large, flat surface area:** Leaves are typically broad and flat, providing a large surface area to maximize the absorption of light energy.
2.  **Presence of chlorophyll:** They contain chloroplasts, which are rich in chlorophyll, the pigment that traps light energy.
3.  **Thinness:** Leaves are very thin, which ensures a short diffusion distance for light to penetrate to the photosynthetic cells (mesophyll cells) and for gases (carbon dioxide and oxygen) to move in and out.
4.  **Stomata:** The presence of stomata on the leaf surface allows for efficient diffusion and absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is a key reactant for photosynthesis.
5.  **Extensive vascular system:** A network of xylem vessels transports water (another reactant) to the leaf cells, while phloem vessels transport manufactured sugars away from the leaf."
"Fig. 9.1(b) illustrates that the leaves of the plant fold at night, a phenomenon referred to as 'sleep movement'. The question asks for the effect of these movements on water loss and an explanation for it.The folding of the leaves at night, as seen in Fig. 9.1(b), is called a sleep movement. Suggest and explain the effect of these sleep movements on the loss of water from one of these plants.","The effect of these sleep movements (folding of leaves at night) is a reduction in the rate of water loss from the plant, specifically by lowering the rate of transpiration.

**Explanation:** When leaves fold, their total surface area exposed to the surrounding air is reduced. This reduction in exposed surface area minimizes the number of stomata directly exposed to the external environment, thereby decreasing the rate at which water vapor can diffuse out of the leaf. Additionally, the folding can create a microclimate of higher humidity immediately surrounding the folded leaves, which reduces the water vapor concentration gradient between the inside of the leaf and the outside air, further slowing down the rate of evaporation and protecting the stomata from air currents."
"Fig. 9.2 is a line graph showing the 'uptake or loss of oxygen' by a leaf over a 24-hour period. The y-axis indicates net oxygen movement, where '+' means net uptake by the leaf (consumption from atmosphere) and '-' means net loss from the leaf (release to atmosphere). The x-axis represents time from midnight to midnight.

From approximately 0600 hours to 1800 hours, the graph shows a significant net loss of oxygen from the leaf (the line is below the '0' mark, reaching its lowest point around noon). This means the plant is releasing oxygen to the atmosphere.Explain what is happening in the leaf at the following times: from noon to 1800 hours.","From noon to 1800 hours (6 PM), the plant is experiencing high light levels, which allows for a high and possibly maximum rate of photosynthesis. During this period, the rate of photosynthesis (which produces oxygen) is significantly higher than the rate of respiration (which consumes oxygen). As a result, there is a net production of oxygen, and this excess oxygen diffuses out of the plant into the atmosphere. The graph shows a significant net loss of oxygen *from the leaf* (meaning release *to the atmosphere*) during this time, reaching its most negative value (highest net release) around noon, consistent with peak photosynthetic activity."

The y-axis indicates net oxygen movement, where '+' means net uptake by the leaf (consumption from atmosphere) and '-' means net loss from the leaf (release to atmosphere). The x-axis represents time from midnight to midnight.

Between 1800 hours and 2200 hours, the graph shows a transition. The net loss of oxygen from the leaf decreases rapidly after 1800 hours, crosses the '0' line around 1900-2000 hours, and then moves into the positive region, indicating a net uptake of oxygen by the leaf. This period corresponds to decreasing light levels and the onset of darkness.Explain what is happening in the leaf at the following times: between 1800 hours and 2200 hours.","Between 1800 hours and 2200 hours, light levels are rapidly decreasing as evening transitions into night. Consequently, the rate of photosynthesis, which produces oxygen, slows down significantly and eventually stops completely in the absence of light. However, the plant continues to carry out respiration (which consumes oxygen) continuously throughout both day and night. As the rate of oxygen production by photosynthesis falls below or ceases entirely, the leaf switches from a net release of oxygen to a net uptake of oxygen from the atmosphere to meet its respiratory demands. This is reflected in the graph by the curve crossing the zero line and moving into the positive region (net uptake by the leaf)."

For a 1.8% salt solution, the initial diameter was 7.5 µm, and after two minutes, it decreased to 6.0 µm.(b) (i) Explain the results for the red blood cells that were immersed in 1.8% salt solution.","For the red blood cells immersed in 1.8% salt solution, the mean diameter reduced from 7.5 µm to 6.0 µm. This is because the 1.8% salt solution has a lower water potential than the red blood cells. As a result, water moved out of the red blood cells by osmosis, causing them to shrink."

This means there was no net movement of water into or out of the cells by osmosis.
"The previous questions discuss John's normal heart rate (65-66 bpm at rest, up to 110 bpm during exercise, recovering to 68 bpm) and oxygen saturation (98-99% at rest, briefly dipping to 96% during exercise, recovering to 98%). The question asks to compare a heavy smoker with emphysema to John.(b) A man is a heavy smoker and is suffering from emphysema. Suggest how this person's normal pulse rate and percentage of oxygen in his blood may vary from those of John in (a).","A heavy smoker suffering from emphysema would likely have a higher normal pulse rate than John. This is because emphysema damages the alveolar walls, reducing the surface area for gaseous exchange, leading to less oxygen being absorbed into the blood. The heart has to pump harder and faster to compensate for the reduced oxygen supply to the body's tissues. Consequently, his normal percentage of oxygen in the blood would be lower than John's because his lungs are less efficient at taking in maximum oxygen with each breath, leading to lower oxygen saturation."

Wilting is a visible symptom of significant water loss.(b) (iv) State which of the plants wilted the most and explain why.","Plant A wilted the most. This is because Plant A experienced the highest percentage mass loss (approximately -8%), indicating it lost the most water. Its pot was covered, preventing soil evaporation, but the leaves were exposed, allowing maximum transpiration. In contrast, Plant B was entirely enclosed in a plastic bag, creating high humidity around its leaves, which significantly reduced transpiration and thus minimized water loss and wilting. Plant C had its pot covered but its leaves exposed, similar to A, but likely had fewer leaves or a smaller surface area for transpiration compared to A, resulting in an intermediate water loss."

In the pedigree: Parent H is a carrier female (half-filled circle). Parent J is an unaffected male (clear square). This implies H's genotype is Aa and J's genotype is AA.(b) (i) Using the letters, A and a, state the genotype of parent H.","According to the key, a carrier female is represented by a half-filled circle. Since sickle-cell anaemia is a homozygous recessive disease (aa), 'A' represents the dominant allele and 'a' represents the recessive allele. Therefore, a carrier individual, like parent H, must have one dominant and one recessive allele. The genotype of parent H is Aa."

"Fig 7.1 is a line graph illustrating the 'Number of measles antibodies in the blood' (y-axis) over 'Time' (x-axis), showing responses to vaccination and subsequent infection. Initially, there are no antibodies. At the time of 'Vaccination', the antibody level gradually rises to a moderate peak (primary response) and then slowly declines. Later, at the time of 'Infection', the antibody level rapidly and steeply rises to a much higher peak (secondary response) compared to the vaccination response, before gradually declining again. The peak antibody level after infection is significantly higher and achieved much faster than after vaccination.(c) Using Fig 7.1, explain why the child experienced a milder form of measles and took a shorter time to recover from measles.","The child experienced a milder form of measles and recovered faster because the vaccination had already primed their immune system. As shown in Fig 7.1, after vaccination, the body produced a primary immune response, generating a moderate level of measles antibodies and memory cells. When the child was later exposed to the actual infection, these memory cells triggered a rapid and robust secondary immune response, leading to a much faster and significantly higher production of antibodies. This quick and strong immune response allowed the child to effectively fight off the virus, resulting in milder symptoms and a quicker recovery."
No specific context text for this question; it relies on general biological knowledge about vaccination.(d) (ii) What is the advantage of vaccinating a large proportion of the population against measles?,"The advantage of vaccinating a large proportion of the population against measles is the establishment of herd immunity. When a high percentage of the population is immune, it significantly reduces the transmission of the virus within the community, protecting individuals who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants, immunocompromised individuals) from infection. This makes outbreaks less likely and can eventually lead to the eradication of the disease."
"Fig 8.1 displays two ecological pyramids for a sycamore tree ecosystem: a 'pyramid of numbers' and a 'pyramid of biomass'. The 'pyramid of numbers' shows the trophic levels as follows: at the base is 'tree' (represented by a single, narrow bar); above it are 'insects' (a wide bar, indicating many individuals); then 'birds' (a narrower bar, indicating fewer individuals than insects); and at the top, 'birds of prey' (the narrowest bar, indicating the fewest individuals). This pyramid is inverted at the base, then upright. The 'pyramid of biomass' shows the trophic levels as: 'tree' (the largest bar at the base, representing significant biomass); above it, 'insects' (a smaller bar); then 'birds' (an even smaller bar); and 'birds of prey' (the smallest bar at the top). This pyramid maintains an upright, triangular shape, with biomass decreasing at successive trophic levels.8 (a) Using Fig 8.1, describe and explain the different shapes of the two pyramids.","The pyramid of numbers has an unusual, partly inverted shape. Its base, representing the 'tree' trophic level, is very narrow (a single sycamore tree). Above it, the 'insects' level is very wide, indicating that one large tree supports a large number of individual insects. This is an inverted base. The subsequent levels, 'birds' and 'birds of prey', are progressively narrower, indicating fewer individuals at higher trophic levels, forming an upright part of the pyramid. This shape is due to the large size of the producer (one tree) supporting numerous primary consumers (insects). In contrast, the pyramid of biomass has a typical upright, broad-based shape. The 'tree' forms the widest base, representing the largest total biomass. Each successive trophic level ('insects', 'birds', 'birds of prey') has a smaller total biomass. This is because only about 10% of the energy (and thus biomass) is transferred from one trophic level to the next, with significant energy loss at each transfer."

Test tube C contains milk, enzyme X, and bile; its indicator colour is pink at 0 minutes, then turns colourless at 20 minutes, and remains colourless at 40 minutes. Enzyme X is lipase, which breaks down fats.Describe and explain the difference in results between the test-tubes A, B and C.","In test tube A (milk and bile), the indicator colour remained pink throughout the 40 minutes, indicating no digestion of fat occurred and the solution remained alkaline. This shows that bile alone does not chemically digest fats or make the solution acidic. In test tube B (milk and enzyme X, which is lipase), the indicator turned colourless at 40 minutes, indicating that fat was digested, and fatty acids were produced, making the solution acidic. This demonstrates that lipase is required for the breakdown of fats in milk. In test tube C (milk, enzyme X, and bile), the indicator turned colourless much faster, at 20 minutes, and remained colourless at 40 minutes. This indicates that bile helps to speed up the digestion of fats by emulsifying them, increasing the surface area for lipase to act upon, leading to a faster production of fatty acids and a quicker change to an acidic, colourless solution."
The question asks for the expected appearance of a cell from a potato cube and a red blood cell after being immersed in distilled water for 30 minutes. Distilled water has a very high water potential (close to zero).Suggest and explain the expected appearance of a cell from a potato cube and a red blood cell that has been immersed in distilled water for 30 minutes.,"A cell from a potato cube, when immersed in distilled water, will become turgid. This is because distilled water has a higher water potential than the potato cell cytoplasm. Water will move by osmosis into the potato cell, causing the cell membrane to press against the cell wall. The rigid cell wall prevents the plant cell from bursting, so it becomes firm or turgid. A red blood cell, when immersed in distilled water, will burst (haemolyse). This is because distilled water has a higher water potential than the red blood cell cytoplasm. Water will move by osmosis into the red blood cell. Since red blood cells do not have a cell wall to withstand the inward pressure of water, the cell membrane will rupture, causing the cell to burst."

This recovery is due to the repayment of the oxygen debt. The lactic acid accumulated during vigorous exercise is transported to the liver and converted back to glucose or oxidised, which removes the acidic compounds from the muscles, allowing the pH to return to normal."
"Fig. 3.1 is a diagram of a mammalian heart. Structure X is a Semi-lunar valve (as identified in question 3(a)(iv)), which prevents the backflow of blood and ensures one-way flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary arteries. Fig. 3.2 is a graph showing the pH in muscles during and after vigorous exercise, where pH decreases during exercise (due to lactic acid production from anaerobic respiration) and gradually recovers afterwards. If structure X does not close fully, it would lead to reduced efficiency of blood circulation, potentially impairing oxygen delivery to muscles and lactic acid removal.A patient had a condition where the structure X does not close fully. Suggest and explain how that would affect the results in Fig 3.2.","If structure X (a semi-lunar valve) does not close fully, it would lead to a longer time taken for the pH in the muscles to increase back to the resting level of 7.07. This is because the incomplete closure of the valve would reduce the efficiency of blood flow, potentially leading to less oxygen being delivered to the muscles and/or less lactic acid being removed from the muscles. This impaired oxygen supply and lactic acid removal would prolong anaerobic respiration and the acidic conditions in the muscles, resulting in a slower recovery of pH. Additionally, it could lead to a lower pH being reached during the initial 2 minutes of vigorous exercise due to an already compromised oxygen supply."

These numerous and large air spaces reduce the overall density of the leaf, allowing it to float on the water surface. This positioning is crucial as it keeps the upper surface of the leaf accessible to sunlight for photosynthesis and to atmospheric carbon dioxide for gas exchange."
"A scientist calculated the mean number of stomata per mm² in the upper and lower epidermis of tomato plants (a land plant) and water lily plants (a hydrophyte).

For a water lily plant, there are 475 stomata per mm² in the upper epidermis and 0 in the lower epidermis.Compare and explain the differences in the mean number of stomata in a tomato plant and in a water lily plant.","A water lily plant has significantly more stomata (475 per mm²) on its upper epidermis compared to a tomato plant (10 per mm²). Conversely, the water lily has no stomata on its lower epidermis, whereas the tomato plant has a high number (129 per mm²) on its lower epidermis. The explanation for these differences lies in their environments. A tomato plant, being a land plant, needs to conserve water and reduce water loss through transpiration, which primarily occurs from the lower epidermis where stomata are abundant and less exposed to direct sunlight. Water lilies, as aquatic plants, float on water, meaning only their upper surface is exposed to the air and sunlight. Since water conservation is not an issue for water lilies, and their lower surface is submerged, having a large number of stomata on the upper epidermis maximizes gas exchange for photosynthesis, while stomata on the lower epidermis would be useless for gas exchange and susceptible to fungal and bacterial infections if submerged."

A new species of starfish is introduced into this food web, and this starfish species eats limpets.Predict and explain what would happen to the number of dogwhelks and algae in this area after the starfish were introduced.","After the introduction of the starfish that eats limpets, the number of dogwhelks will decrease. This is because the starfish will compete with dogwhelks for limpets, which are a food source for both. With increased predation on limpets, there will be fewer limpets available for the dogwhelks, leading to a reduction in their population due to food scarcity. Conversely, the number of algae will increase. Since the starfish consumes limpets, the population of limpets will decrease. As limpets are herbivores that feed on algae, fewer limpets will result in less consumption of algae, allowing the algae population to grow."

For offspring 5 to be unaffected (genotype hh), they must have inherited a recessive 'h' allele from both parents. Since Individual 2 is unaffected, her genotype is hh. Therefore, Individual 1, who is affected, must possess one dominant 'H' allele and one recessive 'h' allele, making his genotype Hh.

Firstly, fewer doses of erythromycin were used during this period, reducing the selective pressure for resistant bacteria to thrive. Secondly, there might have been the development and use of new antibiotics, alternative treatments, or vaccines, which would have reduced the reliance on erythromycin. Thirdly, increased awareness and education about the dangers of antibiotic overuse and resistance could have led to more prudent prescribing and usage of antibiotics. Additionally, improved detection and screening of pathogens to prevent their spread, better cleanliness and hygiene practices, or a higher proportion of vaccinated individuals contributing to herd immunity, could have all played a role in reducing the prevalence of resistant infections. Finally, isolating infected individuals would also help to contain the spread of resistant strains."
No visual information is provided. The question asks for an explanation of how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics.Explain how bacteria become resistant to antibiotics.,"Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics through a process driven by natural selection. Random mutations occur in the genetic material of some bacteria, leading to genetic variation within the bacterial population. Some of these mutations may confer an advantage, such as the ability to survive in the presence of an antibiotic. When an antibiotic is used, it acts as a selective pressure, killing off susceptible bacteria. However, bacteria with the resistance-conferring mutation survive and reproduce. These resistant bacteria then pass on their resistant genes or alleles to their offspring and can also transfer them horizontally to other bacteria. Over time, this leads to an increase in the frequency of the resistant allele or gene in the bacterial population, resulting in a population that is largely resistant to the antibiotic."
"Salmonella bacteria, which are resistant to erythromycin, cause food poisoning. They can reproduce between 5.2°C and 46.0°C and are killed after 10 minutes at 75.0°C. Transmission typically occurs through contaminated food, often from animal faeces. The question asks to suggest and explain ways to prevent the spread of food poisoning caused by Salmonella bacteria.Salmonella bacteria is resistant to erythromycin. Salmonella bacteria can cause food poisoning and are able to reproduce when the temperature is between 5.2°C and 46.0°C. Salmonella bacteria are killed after 10 minutes at 75.0°C. The bacteria is usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal faeces. Suggest and explain the ways of preventing the spread of food poisoning caused by Salmonella bacteria.","To prevent the spread of food poisoning caused by Salmonella bacteria, several measures can be taken, ensuring bacteria cannot reproduce and are not transmitted: 
1. **Proper food storage**: Store food, especially perishable items, in the fridge or freezer at temperatures below 5.2°C. This inhibits bacterial reproduction.
2. **Thorough cooking**: Cook food, particularly meat and poultry, to a high temperature, at least 75.0°C, and maintain this temperature for the recommended duration (e.g., 10 minutes). This ensures that Salmonella bacteria are killed.
3. **Avoid cross-contamination**: Wash hands thoroughly before preparing food and after handling raw meat or animal waste. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw and cooked foods to prevent the transfer of bacteria. Cover food to prevent contamination.
4. **Safe water use**: Use filtered or boiled water for cooking, especially in areas where water quality might be compromised.
5. **Hygienic practices**: Ensure cooking utensils and surfaces are clean. Promptly dispose of food waste properly to avoid attracting pests that can spread bacteria. These actions collectively limit bacterial growth and break the transmission pathway of Salmonella."
"Fig. 8.1 is a graph showing the thickness of the uterus lining (y-axis) over the day of the menstrual cycle (x-axis, 0 to 30 days). From Day 0 to approximately Day 5, the uterus lining is thin and decreases, representing menstruation. From Day 5 to approximately Day 14, the lining gradually increases in thickness. From Day 14 to approximately Day 28-30, the lining continues to thicken significantly, reaching its maximum thickness before beginning to decrease again after Day 28-30. The question asks to name and describe the actions of two hormones that regulate these changes.Using Fig. 8.1, name and describe the actions of two hormones that regulate the changes to the uterine lining.","Two hormones that regulate the changes to the uterine lining are oestrogen and progesterone. 
1. **Oestrogen**: From approximately Day 5 to Day 14 (pre-ovulation phase), as observed in the graph where the uterus lining starts to increase in thickness, oestrogen levels rise. Oestrogen is responsible for the repair and proliferation of the uterine lining, causing it to thicken again after menstruation. 
2. **Progesterone**: After ovulation, from approximately Day 14 to Day 28-30, progesterone levels increase, along with continued oestrogen production. Progesterone, as indicated by the significant thickening and maintenance of the uterine lining during this phase, is primarily responsible for maintaining and further thickening the uterine lining, making it rich in blood vessels and ready for implantation. If fertilisation and implantation do not occur, both oestrogen and progesterone levels drop, leading to the breakdown and shedding of the uterine lining (menstruation), as seen from Day 0 to Day 5 where the lining decreases in thickness."
"The pancreas releases two hormones, insulin and glucagon, to regulate blood glucose levels. The question asks to describe and explain how each of these hormones regulates blood glucose level.Pancreas releases two important hormones to regulate the blood sugar level. Describe and explain how these hormones regulates blood glucose level. Insulin, Glucagon","**Insulin**: When blood glucose levels increase above normal (e.g., after a meal), the pancreas releases insulin. Insulin acts on target cells (like liver and muscle cells) to increase their permeability to glucose, allowing them to absorb more glucose from the blood. It also promotes the conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage in the liver and muscles. This process effectively decreases blood glucose levels back to the normal range.

**Glucagon**: When blood glucose levels decrease below normal (e.g., during prolonged fasting or exercise), the pancreas releases glucagon. Glucagon primarily acts on the liver, stimulating the breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose (glycogenolysis) and promoting the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (gluconeogenesis). This releases glucose into the bloodstream, thereby increasing blood glucose levels back to the normal range."

"The explanation describes the physiological response when an eye, previously covered, is uncovered, leading to pupil constriction. It includes the following steps: 1. [Change in stimulus]: As the right eye was uncovered again, increased light intensity was detected by the photoreceptors. 2. [Transmission]: Nerve impulses were transmitted to the iris muscles. 3. Muscular action: Circular muscles contract, and radial muscles relax. 4. [Purpose]: This action reduces the amount of light entering the eye to prevent retina damage.

"The explanation describes the process of bioaccumulation and biomagnification of mercury in a food chain: 1. Bioaccumulation: Occurs up the food chain. Phytoplankton (producers) absorb mercury from the water (0.5 mark). 2. Persistence: Mercury is non-biodegradable and is not excreted from the body of organisms (1 mark). 3. Biomagnification: As organisms like mackerel feed on a large quantity of phytoplankton to obtain sufficient energy, the absorbed mercury increases in concentration and accumulates (0.5 mark). This process continues up each successive trophic level. Humans, being at the fourth trophic level (top predators), will accumulate the most mercury (0.5 mark). 4. Consequence: The accumulated mercury may become toxic and cause death (0.5 mark).

Mercury is non-biodegradable and is not excreted from the bodies of the organisms, leading to its accumulation (1m). As organisms like mackerel feed on large quantities of phytoplankton to obtain sufficient energy, the absorbed mercury increases in concentration within their bodies (0.5m). This process of biomagnification continues up each trophic level, meaning humans, being at the fourth trophic level, will accumulate the highest concentration of mercury (0.5m). This high concentration of mercury can become toxic and may lead to death (0.5m)."

A xylem vessel is a dead, hollow plant cell that lacks a nucleus and cytoplasm at maturity, primarily for water transport.Which mature cell contains a nucleus?
A red blood cell
B root hair cell

"The table presents three biological processes: active transport, diffusion, and osmosis, indicating whether they can occur through a partially permeable membrane using a key where '√' means 'yes' and 'X' means 'no'. Active transport involves the movement of substances across a membrane against a concentration gradient, requiring energy and specific carrier proteins; it occurs through a partially permeable membrane. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration; it can occur with or without a membrane, and while it can happen across a partially permeable membrane (for small molecules), it is not exclusively dependent on it. Osmosis is specifically defined as the net movement of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, thus always requiring a partially permeable membrane.Which process can only occur through a partially permeable membrane?
active transport diffusion osmosis key
A √ √ √ √ = yes
B √ X X X = no
C √ X √
D X √ √","C. This option correctly indicates that active transport (√) occurs through a partially permeable membrane and osmosis (√) occurs through a partially permeable membrane. It also suggests that diffusion (X) does not exclusively rely on a partially permeable membrane for its occurrence, or is considered 'no' in this context of exclusive requirement. Osmosis is the only one of the three processes that, by definition, strictly requires a partially permeable membrane."
"The graph displays the percentage change in length of potato strips over four hours when placed in sugar solutions of varying concentrations. The x-axis represents the concentration of sugar solution in mol dm⁻³ (ranging from 0.0 to 0.4), and the y-axis shows the percentage change in length of the potato strips (positive for increase, negative for decrease). The curve starts with a positive percentage change in length at low sugar concentrations, decreases as concentration increases, and crosses the x-axis (zero percentage change) at approximately 0.15 mol dm⁻³. After this point, the percentage change becomes negative, indicating a decrease in potato strip length.Which concentration of sugar solution has approximately the same water potential as the potato?
A 0.00 mol dm⁻³
B 0.15 mol dm⁻³
C 0.30 mol dm⁻³
D 0.40 mol dm⁻³","B. The water potential of the potato is approximately the same as the external sugar solution when there is no net change in the potato strip's length, meaning zero percentage change. On the graph, the curve crosses the x-axis (zero percentage change) at approximately 0.15 mol dm⁻³."
"The table shows the results of food tests performed on an unknown food sample. When iodine reagent was added, the observation was 'remains yellow', indicating a negative test for starch. Benedict's solution produced an 'orange precipitate', which is a positive test for reducing sugars. Biuret reagent resulted in 'remains blue', a negative test for protein. Finally, the ethanol test yielded 'remains clear', indicating a negative test for fats.What is the unknown sample most likely to be?
A apple slices
B butter
C fried fish
D toasted bread","A. The test results indicate the presence of reducing sugars (positive Benedict's test) and the absence of starch, protein, and fats. Apple slices are known to contain significant amounts of sugars and very little starch, protein, or fat, making them the most likely sample. Butter is rich in fat, fried fish in protein and fat, and toasted bread in starch, none of which fit the observed test results."
"The diagram illustrates a petri dish containing agar jelly with starch. Four holes (A, B, C, D) are filled with different solutions. Hole A contains amylase solution. Hole B contains gastric protease solution and hydrochloric acid. Hole C contains gastric protease solution. Hole D contains amylase solution and hydrochloric acid. Amylase is an enzyme that digests starch and works best at a neutral pH. Gastric protease (pepsin) digests proteins and works best in highly acidic conditions (due to hydrochloric acid). Hydrochloric acid will denature amylase.After 30 minutes, which hole will be surrounded by the largest area without starch?","A. Amylase is the enzyme responsible for digesting starch. In hole A, the amylase solution is present, presumably at a neutral pH which is optimal for amylase activity. In holes B and C, gastric protease, which digests protein, is present, and therefore will not break down starch. In hole D, amylase is present with hydrochloric acid, which will denature the amylase and inhibit its activity. Thus, the amylase in hole A will be most effective in digesting starch, resulting in the largest area without starch."
"The graph illustrates the percentage of undigested food molecules for fats, carbohydrates, and proteins as they pass through the alimentary canal, from mouth to anus. The x-axis represents the location along the alimentary canal, starting at the mouth and ending at the anus. Part X is an intermediate point along this canal. Before X, the percentage of undigested carbohydrates and proteins decreases significantly and then largely flattens out. The percentage of undigested fats remains high and relatively flat before X, but then starts to decrease significantly after X.What is part X likely to be?
A duodenum
B ileum
C oesophagus
D stomach","D. In the human digestive system, carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth and is largely halted in the acidic environment of the stomach. Protein digestion begins in the stomach, while fat digestion is minimal until the small intestine. Given that carbohydrate and protein digestion show significant drops and then flatten out largely before X, and fat digestion only begins its significant decrease after X, X is most likely the stomach. This marks the transition point where major protein digestion has occurred, carbohydrate digestion has ceased, and fat digestion has not yet substantially begun."
"The graph illustrates pressure changes (in kPa) within the atrium (dotted line), ventricle (solid line), and aorta (dashed line) over time (in seconds) during a single cardiac cycle. Point W is at approximately 0.1 seconds, where the ventricular pressure begins to rise sharply and crosses the atrial pressure line. Point X is at approximately 0.25 seconds, where both ventricular and aortic pressures reach their peak and begin to fall. Atrioventricular (AV) valves close when ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure. Semilunar valves open when ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure and close when ventricular pressure falls below aortic pressure.What happens to the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves between W and X?
atrioventricular valve semilunar valve
A closed closed
B closed open
C open closed
D open open","A. Point W marks the beginning of ventricular systole, where the ventricular pressure rises above atrial pressure, causing the atrioventricular valves to close. Immediately following this, for a brief period known as isovolumetric contraction, the ventricular pressure continues to rise, but is still below aortic pressure, meaning the semilunar valves remain closed. During this initial phase between W and just before the semilunar valves open, both the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves are closed."
"The graph shows the concentration of lactic acid (in arbitrary units) in an athlete's leg muscles over time (in minutes) from the start of a race. The lactic acid concentration rises from zero, peaks around 2 minutes, remains at a high plateau between 2 and 6 minutes, and then declines steadily from 6 minutes until 10 minutes, returning close to zero.How long did the athlete run for?
A 2 minutes
B 4 minutes
C 6 minutes
D 10 minutes","B. Lactic acid accumulates in the muscles during intense anaerobic exercise and is subsequently cleared from the muscles during recovery. The graph shows lactic acid concentration rising from the start of the race, suggesting active running. If the athlete ran for 4 minutes, lactic acid would have been produced and accumulated during this period. The subsequent plateau and gradual decline observed in the graph, particularly after 6 minutes, indicate the body's recovery process following the cessation of strenuous activity, which could start after 4 minutes of running."
"The diagram compares the bronchus lining of a smoker and a non-smoker. The non-smoker's lining shows healthy, intact cilia (hair-like projections) and fewer mucus-producing goblet cells. In contrast, the smoker's lining shows significantly damaged or absent cilia and a greater number of goblet cells, indicating increased mucus production.Why is it harder for the smoker to remove mucus from his respiratory tract?","C. In a smoker's respiratory tract, a significant number of cilia, which are responsible for sweeping mucus and trapped particles upwards out of the airways, are damaged or destroyed. This impairment of ciliary function makes it much harder to effectively remove the increased mucus produced, leading to mucus accumulation and smoker's cough."
"The diagram shows a dialysis machine for removing waste products from blood. Blood flows from the patient's artery into the machine (labeled 'Blood 2') and returns to the patient's vein (labeled 'Blood 1'). Dialysis fluid flows into the machine (labeled 'Dialysis fluid 4') and exits (labeled 'Dialysis fluid 3'). The dialysis process involves the diffusion of waste products, such as urea, from the blood across a partially permeable membrane into the dialysis fluid, which initially has a very low or zero concentration of these wastes.Where would the urea concentration be the highest?
A 1 and 2
B 1 and 4
C 2 and 3
D 2 and 4","C. Urea is a waste product in the blood, so the blood entering the dialysis machine from the patient's artery ('Blood 2') will have a high concentration of urea. As this blood passes through the machine, urea diffuses into the dialysis fluid. Consequently, the dialysis fluid leaving the machine ('Dialysis fluid 3') will have accumulated urea from the blood, resulting in a high urea concentration."
"The table provides concentration data for glucose, sodium ions, and urea in two fluid samples, P and Q, obtained from different parts of a kidney nephron. Fluid P contains 0.0 g/L glucose, 5.0 g/L sodium ions, and 20.0 g/L urea. Fluid Q contains 0.9 g/L glucose, 3.5 g/L sodium ions, and 0.3 g/L urea. In a healthy kidney, glucose is completely reabsorbed from the filtrate in the proximal convoluted tubule, while urea is concentrated as water is reabsorbed, and sodium ions are actively reabsorbed throughout the nephron. The initial filtrate (glomerular filtrate) contains glucose, sodium ions, and urea at concentrations similar to blood plasma.Which parts of the kidney nephron were fluids P and Q extracted from?
fluid P fluid Q
A collecting duct glomerulus
B glomerulus collecting duct
C glomerulus proximal convoluted tubule
D proximal convoluted tubule collecting duct","A. Fluid P has no glucose (0.0 g/L) and a very high concentration of urea (20.0 g/L), indicating that all glucose has been reabsorbed and water has been extensively removed, concentrating the urine. This composition is characteristic of fluid in the collecting duct. Fluid Q has a significant concentration of glucose (0.9 g/L), moderate sodium ions (3.5 g/L), and low urea (0.3 g/L), resembling the initial glomerular filtrate that forms after filtration in the glomerulus before extensive reabsorption occurs."
"The graph illustrates the concentration changes of blood glucose (solid line) and a specific hormone (dashed line) over time. The blood glucose concentration fluctuates, rising and then falling. The hormone's concentration rises when blood glucose is high or rising, and then falls as blood glucose falls, showing a direct correlation where high glucose levels trigger hormone release, which in turn leads to a decrease in blood glucose.What is the hormone and what is its effect?
hormone effect
A glucagon glucose is converted to glycogen
B glucagon glycogen is converted to glucose
C insulin glucose is converted into glycogen
D insulin glycogen is converted into glucose","C. The graph shows that the hormone's concentration increases in response to high blood glucose levels, and its action leads to a decrease in blood glucose. This describes the function of insulin, which is released by the pancreas when blood glucose is high. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by body cells and stimulates the liver and muscle cells to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage, thereby lowering blood glucose."
"The graph shows changes in the 'thickness of lens' (in arbitrary units) over a period of 10 seconds. From 0-2 seconds, the lens thickness is low and constant. From 2-4 seconds, the lens thickness increases sharply. Between 4-6 seconds, the lens thickness is high and constant. From 6-8 seconds, the lens thickness decreases sharply, returning to its low and constant state for 8-10 seconds.What is happening to the eye between the 4th and 6th seconds?
A ciliary muscles contract
B circular muscles contract
C suspensory ligaments slacken
D suspensory ligaments are pulled taut","D. When suspensory ligaments are pulled taut, they exert tension on the lens, causing it to flatten and become thinner. This flattened configuration reduces the refractive power of the lens, allowing the eye to focus on distant objects. If the graph's y-axis represents lens thickness, and it is high, this would correspond to a thick lens for near vision, where suspensory ligaments would typically be slackened."
"Mr. Tan suffered an eye infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus cereus. He was prescribed antibiotics for treatment but occasionally forgot to take his medicine. After a week, the infection remained.What could be a possible reason for this?
A Bacillus cereus is better treated with a vaccine.
B Bacillus cereus grew resistant to antibiotics.
C Mr Tan was given the wrong dosage of antibiotics.
D Mr Tan was prescribed the wrong type of antibiotics.","B. One of the most common consequences of not completing an antibiotic course, or taking it inconsistently (as implied by 'occasionally forgot to take his medicine'), is the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. When antibiotics are not taken as prescribed, some bacteria may survive and evolve resistance, making the antibiotic ineffective for future treatments."
"The table outlines features of bacteria and viruses in terms of presence ('present') or absence ('absent') of certain cellular components. These features are: cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosome, and protein coat.Which correctly describe the difference between a bacterium and a virus?
feature bacterium virus
A cell membrane present present
B cytoplasm absent absent
C ribosome present present
D protein coat absent present","D. Bacteria are prokaryotic cells that lack a protein coat in the way viruses possess one; instead, they have a cell wall and cell membrane. Viruses, on the other hand, are non-cellular entities that consist of genetic material (DNA or RNA) enclosed within a protective protein coat called a capsid. This table entry correctly identifies the presence of a protein coat in viruses and its absence in bacteria."
"The diagram shows a cross-section of a typical green plant leaf, with its cellular contents (chloroplasts) not explicitly drawn but implied by the cell types. The layers are labeled: 1 (upper epidermis, a single transparent cell layer on top), 2 (palisade mesophyll, elongated cells located below the upper epidermis), 3 (spongy mesophyll, irregularly shaped cells with air spaces below the palisade layer), and 4 (lower epidermis, a single cell layer at the bottom, which contains stomata for gas exchange).Which cells contain chloroplasts?
A 1 and 2
B 1 and 4
C 2 and 3
D 2 and 4","D. Palisade mesophyll cells (2) are densely packed with chloroplasts and are the primary site of photosynthesis in a leaf. While the main body of epidermal cells (1 and 4) typically lack chloroplasts, guard cells (specialized epidermal cells that regulate stomatal opening, part of layer 4) do contain chloroplasts and can perform photosynthesis."
"The graph shows the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis in a plant under different temperature conditions (20°C, 25°C, 30°C), all at a constant carbon dioxide concentration of 0.03%. The x-axis represents light intensity, and the y-axis represents the rate of photosynthesis (in arbitrary units). Each curve initially rises linearly with increasing light intensity and then plateaus. The curve for 30°C is the highest, followed by 25°C, and then 20°C. Point W is located on the initial rising, linear portion of the curve for 0.03% CO₂ at 30°C.What factor(s) limit the rate of photosynthesis at W?
A carbon dioxide concentration only
B light intensity only
C light intensity and temperature only
D temperature only","D. At point W, the rate of photosynthesis is increasing along the linear portion of the curve for 30°C, indicating that light intensity is currently limiting the rate of increase. However, the overall maximum rate that can be achieved at higher light intensities is determined by other factors such as temperature and carbon dioxide concentration. As shown by the different curves, temperature significantly influences the photosynthetic rate. Therefore, even though light is increasing the rate, temperature also restricts the maximum potential rate, making temperature a limiting factor at this point, preventing it from reaching even higher rates if it were at an optimal temperature."
"The diagram displays a green plant with several parts labeled. L indicates a mature leaf, which is a primary site of photosynthesis and thus a 'source' of food (sugars). Other labeled parts include: 1 (root tip), 2 (fruit/flower bud), 3 (young leaf/shoot tip), and 4 (a section of the stem). These parts represent various 'sinks' that require food for growth, storage, or reproduction.Where will food made by leaf L be found after translocation?
A 1 only
B 1 and 2 only
C 1, 2 and 3 only
D 1, 2, 3 and 4","D. Food (sugars) produced by photosynthesis in mature leaves (sources like L) is translocated through the phloem to all actively growing parts and storage organs of the plant (sinks). This includes root tips (1) for growth and storage, fruit/flower buds (2) for development, young leaves/shoot tips (3) for growth before they become photosynthetically self-sufficient, and various cells within the stem (4) for growth, storage, and maintenance."
"The question asks which combination of environmental conditions would cause a plant to wilt most quickly. Wilting occurs when the rate of water loss (transpiration) from the plant exceeds the rate of water absorption, leading to a loss of turgor pressure in plant cells. Transpiration is increased by high air movement, low humidity, and high temperatures.Which of the following conditions would cause a plant to wilt most quickly?
air movement humidity temperature
A high low high
B high high low
C low low high
D low high low","A. Wilting is accelerated by conditions that maximize transpiration (water loss). High air movement increases the rate of diffusion of water vapor away from the leaf surface. Low humidity increases the water potential gradient between the leaf and the surrounding air. High temperature increases the kinetic energy of water molecules, leading to a higher rate of evaporation from the leaf. Therefore, a combination of high air movement, low humidity, and high temperature will cause a plant to wilt most quickly."
"The question presents four different diagrams (A, B, C, D) of pyramids of numbers. A pyramid of numbers represents the number of individual organisms at each trophic level in an ecosystem. The base of the pyramid represents producers, followed by primary consumers (herbivores), then secondary consumers, and so on. An inverted pyramid of numbers occurs when the number of producers is less than the number of primary consumers, such as when a single large tree (producer) supports many insects (herbivores).Which pyramid of numbers has more herbivores than producers?","D. In ecology, a pyramid of numbers can sometimes be inverted at its base, meaning there are more primary consumers (herbivores) than producers. This typically occurs when the producers are large individual organisms, such as a single large tree supporting a multitude of smaller herbivorous insects. Option D depicts a pyramid where the lowest level (producers) is wider than the next level (herbivores), which indicates fewer herbivores than producers at that trophic level."
"The diagram illustrates a simplified carbon cycle, showing the movement of carbon among various reservoirs. 'Carbon dioxide in the air' is a central component. 'Plants' take up carbon dioxide. 'Animals' consume plants or other animals. 'Fossil fuels' are formed from ancient organic matter. 'Dead animal and plant matter' represent decomposing organisms. Arrow 1 points from 'carbon dioxide in the air' to 'plants'. Arrow 2 points from 'plants' to 'carbon dioxide in the air'. Arrow 3 points from 'fossil fuels' to 'carbon dioxide in the air'. Arrow 4 points from 'animals' to 'carbon dioxide in the air'.What processes are occurring at 1, 2, 3 and 4?

A combustion photosynthesis respiration decomposition
B photosynthesis respiration combustion decomposition
C photosynthesis combustion decomposition respiration
D respiration photosynthesis combustion photosynthesis","B. Process 1, the uptake of carbon dioxide by plants, is photosynthesis. Process 2, the release of carbon dioxide from plants to the air, is plant respiration. Process 3, the release of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels to the air, is combustion. Process 4, the release of carbon dioxide from animals to the air, is animal respiration. Option B correctly identifies processes 1, 2, and 3, but identifies process 4 as decomposition, whereas it is animal respiration."

D phosphate group deoxyribose sugar nitrogenous base","D. In a DNA nucleotide, the phosphate group (circular shape) is linked to the deoxyribose sugar (pentagonal shape), which in turn is linked to the nitrogenous base (rectangular shape). Thus, X represents the phosphate group, Y represents the deoxyribose sugar, and Z represents the nitrogenous base."
"The diagram illustrates the process of sexual reproduction and gamete formation. Gametes P and Q fuse to produce cell R (a zygote). Subsequently, cell R undergoes meiosis to produce new gametes S, T, U, and V. If P and Q are haploid gametes (n chromosomes), then R is a diploid zygote (2n chromosomes), and S, T, U, V are also haploid gametes (n chromosomes) resulting from meiosis.Which statement about the numbers of chromosomes in the cells and gametes is correct?
A The numbers of chromosomes in P and Q are different.
B The numbers of chromosomes in P and S are the same.
C The number of chromosomes in S is one quarter of the number of chromosomes in R.
D The number of chromosomes in T is half the number of chromosomes in Q.","B. Gametes P and Q are haploid (n chromosomes). Cell R is the diploid zygote (2n chromosomes) formed by the fusion of P and Q. Gametes S, T, U, and V are produced from R through meiosis, so they are also haploid (n chromosomes). Therefore, the number of chromosomes in gamete P (n) and gamete S (n) are the same."
"The diagram shows a wind-pollinated flower. Features typically associated with wind-pollination are often visible, such as small or inconspicuous petals (as there's no need to attract pollinators), anthers positioned to release pollen into the wind, and stigmas adapted to catch wind-borne pollen. The depicted flower has small, unobtrusive petals, anthers that are extended outside the flower, and a large, feathery stigma that is also exposed to the wind.Which features of the flower indicate that is wind-pollinated?
petals position of anther stigma
A large inside flower smooth
B large outside flower feathery
C small inside flower smooth
D small outside flower feathery","D. Wind-pollinated flowers typically have small or absent petals because they do not need to attract insects. Their anthers are usually located outside the flower to allow for easy dispersal of pollen by wind currents. The stigmas are often large and feathery, and also positioned outside, to effectively capture pollen grains carried by the wind. All these features are correctly described in option D and are consistent with a wind-pollinated flower."
"Amniotic band syndrome is a rare condition in pregnant women where the lining of the amniotic sac becomes damaged. The amniotic sac contains amniotic fluid, which serves to cushion and protect the developing fetus, allow for fetal movement, and maintain a stable environment.What is a possible effect of amniotic band syndrome?
A foetus has a higher chance of getting injured
B foetus receives less nutrients from the mother
C increased chance of uterus being damaged by the foetus
D more than one zygote can implant itself on the uterus wall","A. When the lining of the amniotic sac is damaged in amniotic band syndrome, fibrous bands can form within the sac. These bands can entangle, compress, or constrict parts of the developing fetus, leading to various birth defects, deformities, or even amputations. Reduced amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) can also occur, diminishing the cushioning effect and increasing the risk of physical injury to the fetus."
"The diagram presents a sectional view of the male reproductive system, with several structures labeled. A is the vas deferens, a tube for sperm transport.

D is the testis, where sperm are produced.Which structure produces fluid to nourish and activate sperm cells?
A
B
C
D","C. The seminal vesicles (C) are a pair of glands that secrete a significant portion of the fluid that makes up semen. This fluid is rich in fructose, which serves as a nutrient for sperm, and also contains prostaglandins and other substances that aid in sperm motility and activation."
"The question provides a calendar context with a menstrual cycle length of 28 days, starting with menstruation on 5 February. The menstrual cycle typically consists of a follicular phase, ovulation (around day 14 of a 28-day cycle), and a luteal phase. Progesterone levels rise significantly during the luteal phase, after ovulation, to prepare the uterus for potential pregnancy.During which dates will her progesterone levels in the blood increase most rapidly?
A 5-12 February
B 13-19 February
C 20-26 February
D 27 February – 5 March","C. Given a 28-day menstrual cycle starting on 5 February, ovulation would typically occur around Day 14, which corresponds to 18 February (Feb 5 + 13 days). Following ovulation, the corpus luteum forms and begins to produce progesterone, leading to a rapid increase in progesterone levels during the luteal phase. Therefore, the period from 20-26 February, immediately after ovulation, would be when progesterone levels in the blood increase most rapidly."
"The question asks to identify the fertilization combination that would result in a male with Down syndrome. A male typically has XY sex chromosomes. Down syndrome is caused by Trisomy 21, meaning an individual has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. This results from non-disjunction during meiosis, where a gamete receives an extra chromosome 21. Normal human gametes contain 22 autosomes plus either an X or a Y sex chromosome.Which fertilisation would result in a male with Down syndrome?
chromosome in ovum fertilised by chromosome in sperm
A 22 + 1X 22 + 1Y
B 22 + 1X 23 + 1Y
C 23 + 1Y 22 + 1X
D 23 + 1Y 23 + 1X","B. For an individual to be male, the combination of sex chromosomes must be XY. For Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), there must be an extra copy of chromosome 21, meaning one of the gametes contributes 23 autosomes (22 normal + 1 extra 21) instead of the normal 22. Option B shows an ovum with normal chromosomes (22 autosomes + X) fertilized by a sperm carrying an extra autosome (23 autosomes + Y). This fusion results in a zygote with 45 autosomes (including three copies of chromosome 21) and XY sex chromosomes, which is a male with Down syndrome."
"The diagram displays a group of male students in a classroom, all of the same age. The question states that these students exhibit both continuous and discontinuous variation in some of their traits. Continuous variation refers to traits that show a range of phenotypes, often influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors (e.g., height, skin color, arm length). Discontinuous variation refers to traits that fall into distinct categories, typically controlled by a single gene or a few genes with minimal environmental influence (e.g., blood group, gender, presence/absence of certain conditions).The students show both continuous and discontinuous variation in some of their traits.
Which row shows the correct characteristics?
discontinuous variation continuous variation
A blood group, gender length of arm, skin colour
B gender, length of arm blood group, skin colour
C gender, skin colour blood group, length of arm
D length of arm, skin colour blood group, gender","A. Blood group and gender are examples of discontinuous variation, as individuals fall into distinct, non-overlapping categories (e.g., A, B, AB, O for blood groups; male or female for gender). Length of arm and skin color are examples of continuous variation, as they can take on a wide range of values between extremes within the population, typically with normal distribution, and are influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors."

One contractile vacuole is shown at an early stage of filling, while another is shown almost ready to discharge its contents. The Stentor absorbs water from its surroundings due to the difference in salt concentration inside the cell and the surrounding freshwater, and then discharges it by regular contractions of the contractile vacuole.Explain the process of how water enters the Stentor.",Water molecules enter the cell through osmosis by passing through the partially permeable membrane of the cell membrane; The surrounding freshwater has a higher water potential than the water potential of the contractile vacuole / cytoplasm inside the cell; [2] Common errors were not stating partially permeable membrane in their answers and still using terms such as concentration gradient for movement of water. Majority were able to distinguish between which region was of a higher or lower water potential.

Carbon sinks: Fossil fuels (coal/oil/natural gas) buried deep underground Plants and trees in forests store carbon in the form of cellulose in cell walls and starch in leaves are rich sources of carbon sink. [5] Most students are able to name processes H, I and J, but a number did not comment on how these processes affect the carbon dioxide concentration. A number of students lack examination skills in relating these process to Carbon dioxide concentration, students merely define what is respiration, photosynthesis and combustion of fossil fuels. A huge number of students are not aware how the forest functions as a carbon sink. The most common error students made is thinking that because plants take in carbon dioxide and therefore that makes it a carbon sink. Students do not have the understanding that carbon is store in every part of the producers (in the cellulose cell walls, carbon stored as starch in leaves). Many students also put down oceans as carbon sink, but the question requires with reference to Fig. 11.1, there is no mentioned of ocean in Fig 11.1"

The most common error every student made is between day 24 to day 28, where oestrogen and progesterone levels are decreasing causes the uterine lining to decrease in its thickness too. This is not true, not reflected in Fig. 11.2. Only after day 28, the thickness of the uterine lining decreases."
"The question asks to describe the process of fertilization, which is the fusion of gametes, and then to outline the subsequent developmental stages of the human embryo as it progresses into a fetus.Describe the process of fertilisation and outline the early development of the embryo into a fetus.","Fertilisation is the fusion of the nucleic of the egg and the sperm to form the zygote. Zygote then undergoes a series of mitotic cell division / cell division to form a ball of cells known as the embryo. Implantation of embryo into the uterine lining with the formation of embryonic villi Formation of placenta for exchange of nutrients and oxygen into the fetus And removal of urea and carbon dioxide from the fetus to the maternal blood stream Formation of amniotic sac and amniotic fluid to protect the fetus from mechanical shock Presence of umbilical blood vessels (umbilical artery to remove carbon dioxide and urea to maternal blood stream) / umbilical veins to transport oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Any 6 points from above [6] Many students describe the entire event leading to fertilisation which is unnecessary. Hence, students are not aware how to describe what is fertilisation. A large number of students did not mentioned that the nucleus of the sperm fuses with the nucleus of the egg to form a zygote. some students have the tenddency to use the term fertilized egg instead of zygote. A handful of students did not mentioned how zygote develop into an embryo by mitotic cell division / by mitosis. common misconceptions were by meiosis. Some students used the term fertilized egg throughout their answers which is incorrect. Students who only mentioned the term formation of placenta without elaboration on how placenta are formed or the roles of placenta were not awarded any marks."
"The graph, Fig. 1.1, shows the effect of different sodium chloride concentrations on the volume of animal cells. The x-axis represents the concentration of sodium chloride solution in mmol/dm³, ranging from 0 to 80. The y-axis represents the ratio of final volume of cells to original volume of cells, ranging from 0.2 to 1.6. The curve shows that at a concentration of 40 mmol/dm³, the ratio of final volume to original volume is approximately 0.7.Describe and explain the appearance of the animal cells placed in a concentration of sodium chloride solution of 40 mmol/dm³.","The animal cells will shrink. This is because the water potential in the cells is higher than in the sodium chloride solution (40 mmol/dm³), causing water molecules to move out of the cells across a partially permeable membrane via osmosis."

"The experiment described in Question 2a investigates the action of liquid Y on starch. Liquid Y is an enzyme that digests starch, and it functions optimally at pH 7 and when unboiled.Identify the part of the human body that liquid Y is produced naturally.",Liquid Y is produced naturally in the salivary glands.
"Liquid Y is an enzyme that acts on starch, a substrate, in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The 'lock-and-key' hypothesis describes how enzymes interact with their specific substrates.Using the 'lock-and-key' hypothesis, explain the action of liquid Y on starch.","According to the lock-and-key hypothesis, the enzyme in liquid Y acts as the 'lock' and the starch acts as the 'key'. The substrate (starch) has a specific shape that is complementary to the active site of the enzyme. This allows them to bind together to form an enzyme-substrate complex, which then catalyses a chemical reaction to form products."

"Balloon angioplasty, as shown in Fig. 3.3, is a procedure to compress blockages in an artery caused by fatty deposits. Stage 1 shows an artery with fatty deposit and a deflated balloon. Stage 2 shows the balloon inflated, compressing the fatty deposit and widening the lumen. Stage 3 shows the artery wall returning to its original shape after the balloon is removed, with an enlarged lumen, implying the artery wall can stretch and recoil.State a possible cause of occlusion in the artery.","Possible causes of occlusion in the artery include smoking, stress, or a high-cholesterol diet."
"Fig. 3.3 illustrates balloon angioplasty, where an artery wall with a fatty deposit is treated. Stage 2 shows the balloon inflated, stretching the artery wall to compress the fatty deposit. Stage 3 shows the artery wall returning to an enlarged shape after the balloon is removed. This process demonstrates that the artery wall undergoes stretching and recoiling.Describe the structural characteristic of an artery wall when the balloon is inflated and removed for it to give rise to what is shown in stage 2 and 3.","The artery wall is able to stretch and recoil, due to the presence of elastic muscles, tissue, or fibres in its structure."
"The structural characteristic of an artery wall, as demonstrated in balloon angioplasty, is its ability to stretch and recoil due to elastic tissues. This elasticity is crucial for withstanding high blood pressure and maintaining efficient blood flow.Explain what would happen in blood circulation if the artery wall does not have the characteristic mentioned in (b)(ii).","If the artery wall lacks elastic muscles, blood circulation will be at a low speed, be impeded, or have low energy. This is because the artery wall, unable to withstand the high pressure of blood flow, would rupture."
This question asks for a definition related to a medical condition.Define type 2 diabetes mellitus.,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a condition where the blood glucose level is persistently higher than normal.
This question asks for risk factors and management strategies for type 2 diabetes mellitus.Identify one risk factor and one way to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"One risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus is obesity, often linked to high consumption of sugar-rich food, age, family history, sedentary lifestyle, or high blood lipid levels.

"Fig. 5.1 shows a cross-section of a mammalian eye. P is the outermost transparent layer at the front of the eye. Q is the biconvex structure located behind the pupil. R is the muscular, colored part surrounding the pupil, which controls its size. S is the nerve bundle exiting the back of the eye, transmitting visual information to the brain.State the structures labelled P, Q, R and S.","P: cornea, Q: lens, R: iris, S: optic nerve."
"The pupil reflex, involving the iris and optic nerve, allows the pupil to adjust its size in response to varying light intensities, for example, by dilating when moving from a bright to a dimly lit room to allow more light to enter the eye.Suggest why this reflex mentioned in (b)(i) is important.","This reflex is important because it is rapid, instant, and automatic. It allows more light to enter the eye in dim conditions, enabling a person to see better in the dark and preventing possible injury."
The pupil reflex is an involuntary action of the body that helps regulate the amount of light entering the eye.State one other reflex action in the body.,One other reflex action in the body is the knee reflex.
Red blood cells containing the abnormal form of haemoglobin (HbS) become stiff and sickle-shaped in conditions of low oxygen concentration. This gives rise to sickle cell anaemia.Describe and explain how having red blood cells which become sickle-shaped can have a harmful effect on the body.,"The sickle-shaped red blood cells have a decreased surface area-to-volume ratio, leading to less efficient diffusion and transport of oxygen, which results in fatigue and breathlessness. Alternatively, these sickle-shaped red blood cells can clog up capillaries, leading to blood clots that cause a reduced oxygen supply to tissues, ultimately resulting in the death of tissues."
"Inheritance of ABO blood groups involves multiple alleles (I^A, I^B, I^O). Codominance refers to a situation where both alleles in a heterozygote are fully expressed, resulting in a phenotype that is not intermediate but shows characteristics of both alleles.Explain whether inheritance of blood group is an example of codominance.","Yes, inheritance of blood group is an example of codominance, but also includes complete dominance. Specifically, alleles I^A and I^B are codominant, meaning that when both are present (genotype I^A I^B), both are expressed, resulting in blood group AB. However, I^A is dominant over I^O, and I^B is dominant over I^O, meaning if I^A or I^B is present with I^O, only I^A or I^B is expressed."
"The placenta is an organ that develops during pregnancy, connecting the mother and fetus. It facilitates the transfer of substances between them. The small intestines are responsible for nutrient absorption, the lungs for gas exchange (oxygen intake, carbon dioxide removal), and the kidneys for filtering waste products from the blood.Discuss the validity of the statement. “The placenta performs the function of the small intestines, lungs and kidneys for the growing fetus”.","The statement is valid because the placenta performs analogous functions to the small intestines, lungs, and kidneys for the fetus. Firstly, the placenta acts as a small intestine by allowing the diffusion of nutrients from the mother's blood across the placenta into the fetus's blood. Secondly, the placenta acts as the lungs; oxygen carried in the umbilical vein diffuses from the mother's blood across the placenta into the fetus's blood, while carbon dioxide carried in the umbilical artery diffuses from the fetus's blood into the mother's blood. Thirdly, the placenta acts as a kidney, as nitrogenous waste products in the umbilical artery diffuse from the fetus's blood into the mother's blood."
"This question asks for the word equation of photosynthesis, a process where plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, with chlorophyll acting as a catalyst.State the word equation of photosynthesis.","carbon dioxide + water --(light, chlorophyll)--> glucose + oxygen."
"The trend observed from the data is that the rate of photosynthesis is constant at higher light intensities (shorter distances, 10-20mm) and then decreases at lower light intensities (longer distances, 30-60mm). This behavior can be explained using the concept of limiting factors in photosynthesis.Explain your answer in (b)(ii) using the concept of limiting factors.","The rate of photosynthesis remained constant at 6.0 mm per minute when the light intensity decreased (distance of lamp increased from 10mm to 20mm) because light intensity was not the limiting factor in that range. Instead, another factor, such as carbon dioxide concentration, was limiting the rate of photosynthesis. However, as the distance of the lamp increased beyond 30mm, light intensity became the limiting factor on the rate of photosynthesis, causing the rate to decrease."
"Fig. 9.1 shows that hormone A (oestrogen) peaks around day 14, and hormone B (progesterone) starts to rise after day 14. The uterine lining thickness also significantly increases during this period.

Practising abstinence is also an effective way."
This question asks for distinguishing features between a bacterial cell and an animal cell.Describe two features of a bacterial cell that are different from an animal cell.,"Two features of a bacterial cell that are different from an animal cell are: 1. A bacterial cell has a cell wall, whereas an animal cell does not. 2. A bacterial cell has plasmids, whereas an animal cell does not.

"Pneumococcal disease is caused by a bacterium. Vaccines and antibiotics are medical interventions used to combat infectious diseases, but they work through different mechanisms.Vaccines and antibiotics are used in different ways to reduce the number of deaths from pneumococcal disease. Explain the ways in which vaccines and antibiotics are used.","Vaccines work by introducing an agent that resembles *Streptococcus pneumoniae* into the body. When a person is vaccinated, this agent stimulates the white blood cells to produce specific antibodies against the pathogen. These antibodies will then destroy the pathogen. In the future, if the live pathogen enters the bloodstream, the white blood cells will quickly recognise it and produce antibodies rapidly to destroy the pathogen, providing immunity. Antibiotics, on the other hand, directly target and kill bacteria. They can achieve this by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, causing water to enter and eventually burst the bacterial cell. They can also inhibit cell membrane function, allowing substances from the environment to enter the bacterial cell, or inhibit protein synthesis in ribosomes, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth. Some antibiotics also inhibit enzyme action needed for the synthesis of folic acid, inhibiting bacterial growth."
"Excretion is a biological process involving the removal of waste products from the body. The kidneys play a crucial role in this, and also in osmoregulation, which maintains the water potential of body fluids through a negative feedback system. Urea is a main nitrogenous waste product.Define excretion and explain its importance.",Excretion is the process by which metabolic waste products are removed from the body. It is important to remove these waste products because they are harmful and toxic to the body if allowed to accumulate.
"Negative feedback is a regulatory mechanism in biology. Osmoregulation is the process by which the body regulates water potential, and it involves negative feedback. When the water potential of the blood deviates from normal, the body initiates a series of responses to restore it to the normal state.With reference to (a), explain negative feedback and outline its role in osmoregulation.","Negative feedback refers to a mechanism where a stimulus resulting from a change in the internal system triggers a sequence of events that work to restore the system to its original state. In osmoregulation, when the water potential of the blood increases above normal (e.g., due to low water intake), the hypothalamus in the brain detects this change. The pituitary gland then releases less anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) into the bloodstream. This makes the walls in the collecting duct less permeable to water, leading to less water being reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. As a result, more water is excreted, producing more diluted urine with increased volume. This process helps return the water potential in the blood back to its normal state."
"Dialysis is a medical procedure that artificially filters waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys fail. Blood is drawn from the patient, passed through a dialysis machine, and then returned to the body. This process aims to remove substances like urea from the blood.State one way in which blood returning from the dialysis machine back into the body will differ from blood leaving the body to enter the dialysis machine.","The blood returning from the dialysis machine back into the body will have less or no urea (or lower concentration of urea), lower pressure, or fewer metabolic waste products compared to blood leaving the body to enter the dialysis machine."
"Dialysis machines remove waste products from the blood by relying on the principle of diffusion, where substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration across a partially permeable membrane. The dialysis fluid normally contains no urea, creating a steep concentration gradient for urea to diffuse out of the blood.Suggest and explain how the efficiency of dialysis is affected if the dialysis fluid contains a small amount of urea.","If the dialysis fluid contains a small amount of urea, the efficiency of dialysis in removing urea will be lower. This is because there will be a less steep concentration gradient of urea between the blood and the dialysis fluid, resulting in a slower rate of diffusion of urea from the blood into the dialysis fluid."

The hepatic portal vein normally carries blood from the small intestine/ileum to the liver. A 'Y junction' ensures both lobes of the liver receive blood, and a 'T junction' ensures blood from all branches of the portal vein reaches the liver. If blood flow is blocked, nutrient-rich blood will not be transported to the rest of the body, leading to fatigue. Glucose and amino acids absorbed from the small intestine/ileum will be unable to be transported to the liver. This means excess glucose cannot be converted into glycogen for storage, and deamination of amino acids cannot occur, leading to their accumulation in the blood. Additionally, bile production would be reduced, and the lack of blood supply would lead to liver cell death and eventual liver failure. This reduced glucose also means less aerobic respiration and less energy for bile production. The direction of blood flow in the hepatic portal vein is towards the liver.Explain the consequences of a blood clot forming in the hepatic portal vein, including its impact on nutrient transport and liver function.","Lack of nutrient-rich blood is transported to the rest of the body, leading to fatigue. Blood containing glucose and amino acids from the small intestine/ileum is unable to be transported to the liver. No excess glucose can be converted into glycogen for storage. No deamination of amino acids can take place, leading to their accumulation in blood. Reduction in bile production. Lack of blood supply to liver cells leads to cell death and liver failure. (Less glucose leads to less aerobic respiration and less energy released for bile production. Direction of blood flow in hepatic portal vein is TOWARDS LIVER.

"The effects of alcohol consumption can be observed at both individual and societal levels. At the individual level, alcohol causes delayed response and increased reaction time, raising the risk of accidents. It can reduce self-control, leading to aggressive behaviors. Chronic use increases the risk of fatty liver, liver cirrhosis, and gastric ulcers. It also inhibits the liver's ability to detoxify alcohol, leading to alcohol poisoning as alcohol accumulates in the blood, and impairs blood clotting, increasing bleeding if an injury occurs. Furthermore, alcohol compromises the immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections by pathogens. At the societal level, alcohol can lead to increased crime rates, family violence, abusive relationships, financial difficulties due to addiction, and low employment productivity. The answer must explain how alcohol affects the biology of the individual leading to the observed effects, and candidates must present impacts on both individual and society.Discuss the impacts of alcohol consumption on an individual's health and on society.","Effects on individuals include: delayed response/increased reaction time, leading to increased risk of accidents; reduced self-control, leading to aggressive behaviors; increased risk of fatty liver, liver cirrhosis, or gastric ulcers.

"The problem describes a condition where the eye lens is inelastic, meaning it cannot change its thickness or convexness. When viewing a near object, light rays from the object undergo refraction as they pass through the cornea. Due to the inelastic lens remaining thin and less convex, it cannot bend the light rays sufficiently for them to be focused on the retina. Instead, the light rays are focused either in front of or behind the retina. Many candidates recited the accommodation reflex but did not explain the effects of an inelastic lens within the given context. Inaccuracies in structures and shape of the lens were observed.Explain why an inelastic eye lens prevents clear vision of near objects.","If the eye lens is unable to change thickness and convexness, it remains thin and less convex when seeing a near object.

"The blinking reflex involves photoreceptors in the eye detecting a stimulus (e.g., an approaching baseball). This generates a nerve impulse in the receptor, which is then transmitted by sensory neurons towards the brain. The nervous impulse is further transmitted to a relay neuron, across a synapse, and then to a motor neuron. Finally, the nervous impulse travels along the motor neuron towards the effector eyelid muscles, causing the eyelids to contract and relax, producing blinking movements.Describe the nervous pathway involved in the blinking reflex when stimulated by an approaching object.","Photoreceptors in the eye detected the stimulus (e.g., an approaching baseball).

"Global warming is primarily caused by human activities such as the combustion or burning of fossil fuels and non-biodegradable wastes like plastic. These processes release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Additionally, intensive cattle farming releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane.

"In an experiment involving acid diffusion in agar, variables that should be kept constant include: the depth/size/width of the holes/wells, the concentration/volume/type of indicator, the duration of the experiment, and the type of acid. Specifically, the number of drops or three drops of acid in the holes, and the concentration/depth/volume/type of agar are relevant factors. Variations in these factors, such as different drop sizes or adding acid/measuring circles at different times, can lead to errors like greater diffusion distance or inability to identify anomalous results. Other factors to control include air bubbles in syringes and maintaining a constant temperature. The term 'amount' should be avoided, with 'volume' being a better replacement.

"Increased genetic variation in offspring is an advantage, as it enhances the chance of survival and allows the offspring to be more adapted to changes in the environment. This genetic variation arises from meiosis during gamete production. Foraging for nectar by insects is species-specific, which can reduce pollen grain loss and increase stigma-pollen compatibility.Explain the advantages of increased genetic variation in offspring.","Increased genetic variations in offspring lead to: increased chance of survival of offspring, and being more adapted to changes in the environment. (R: prevent self-pollination (vague). A: species/population less susceptible to diseases)."
"Following pollination, the processes of fertilisation and germination of the pollen grain/tube occur. This results in the formation of a diploid zygote when gametes fuse. Confusion between alleles, genotype, and phenotype is a common mistake. Cross-pollination leads to a higher probability of offspring being heterozygous, making it less likely for harmful recessive alleles to be expressed (i.e., less likely to have the harmful recessive phenotype).

Both points are required for 1 mark."
"General biological knowledge about lung anatomy and respiratory function.Explain how lung cancer, characterized by tumors or lumps of cells, affects lung function and leads to breathing difficulty.","Tumors or lumps of cells can block the alveolar wall, alveolar space, alveoli, or bronchiole space, or make the alveolar wall less elastic and less able to inflate/deflate, and reduce the surface area of the alveoli [1]. This condition reduces the volume in the lungs [0.5] and increases pressure in the lungs [0.5]. Alternatively, it decreases the surface area for gaseous exchange or diffusion, leading to a lower rate of gaseous diffusion [1]. Consequently, during inhalation, less air can be forced into the lungs, and during exhalation, less air can flow out of the lungs, resulting in breathing difficulty [1]."
General biological knowledge about environmental science and the impact of agricultural practices.Discuss the environmental benefits of reducing the use of insecticides and fertilizers.,"There are multiple environmental benefits to reducing the use of insecticides and fertilizers:

*   **Water pollution:** There will not be any insecticides or fertilizers in nearby water bodies, leading to reduced or no water pollution and cleaner water [0.5]. This means no bioaccumulation and biomagnification [0.5] of non-biodegradable substances up the food chain, so top consumers are not harmed [0.5]. Additionally, no eutrophication or algal bloom or excessive growth of algae will occur [0.5], preventing the death and decomposition of water plants by bacteria, and thus no increase in bacterial growth [0.5]. This ensures no oxygen depletion in the water, allowing it to maintain high oxygen levels [0.5].
*   **Biodiversity:** Insects in the ecosystem and habitat will not be killed by insecticides [0.5]. This will lead to an increase in biodiversity or no loss of biodiversity [0.5]. Insect pollinators of crops and other plants can continue pollination [0.5], potentially leading to a greater variety of plant species being pollinated [0.5]."
"A study observed the water content of crab muscle cells when crabs were moved to seawater. The water content initially decreased steeply from 76% to 74% and further decreased to 73.8% between day 0 and day 4.5, before gradually increasing to 75% by day 15.Describe the changes in crab muscle cell water content over time in seawater and explain the osmoregulatory mechanisms involved.","Initially, the water content decreases steeply from 76% to 74% and further to 73.8% when crabs are first moved to seawater, specifically from day 0 to day 4.5 [0.5]. This occurs because seawater has a lower water potential than the cytoplasm of the crab's muscle cells [0.5], causing water to move out of the crab's muscle cells via osmosis [0.5]. Subsequently, the water content increases gradually to 75% by day 15 [0.5]. This increase happens as the amino acid content in the muscle cells increases, which decreases the water potential of the muscle cell cytoplasm to become lower than that of seawater [0.5], causing water to move back into the cells via osmosis [0.5]."
"Following the observations of crab osmoregulation in seawater, where amino acid content in muscle cells changes.What is the role of amino acids in the osmoregulation of crabs in seawater?","Amino acids lower the water potential of the crab's cells, which helps to prevent dehydration when the crab is in seawater."
General biological knowledge about human muscle physiology and types of muscle fibers.Explain why fast-twitch muscle fibers are prone to fatigue during vigorous exercise.,"Fast-twitch muscle fibers have low myoglobin content, resulting in a low supply or storage of oxygen. Therefore, they rely on anaerobic respiration [0.5] to release additional energy to meet the energy demand of vigorous exercise [0.5] by converting glucose to lactic acid [0.5]. The buildup of lactic acid then causes fatigue [0.5]."
"General biological knowledge about human muscle physiology and cellular structures.What organelle is abundant in slow-twitch muscle fibers, and why is this adaptation important?","Mitochondrion or mitochondria [1] are abundant in slow-twitch muscle fibers. This is because slow-twitch muscle fibers have more myoglobin, leading to a larger supply of oxygen for aerobic respiration, which requires mitochondria."
General biological knowledge about human muscle physiology and the demands of different types of exercise.Explain why slow-twitch muscle fibers are well-suited for long-distance races.,"Long-distance races require slower and lower intensity muscular contraction over a longer period of time [1]. Slow-twitching muscle fibers are ideal for this as they contract slowly over a prolonged duration, resulting in a lower overall energy demand and lower oxygen demand [1]. During such races, the breathing rate and heart rate are able to supply sufficient oxygen (and glucose) to these slow-twitch muscle fibers, allowing them to carry out aerobic respiration [1]."
"Consider an aquatic environment containing pondweed and a snail. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants during photosynthesis and released by living organisms during respiration. A specific condition is reached where the net carbon dioxide exchange is zero.Explain the carbon dioxide exchange between a pondweed and a snail in an aquatic environment, especially at the point where net carbon dioxide exchange is zero.",Carbon dioxide is absorbed by the pondweed during photosynthesis and released by both the pondweed and snail during respiration [1]. The rate of photosynthesis of the pondweed equals the rate of respiration of both the pondweed and the snail [1]. This implies an idea of rates [0.5] and direction (carbon dioxide is not 'converted').
"Consider an aquatic environment containing pondweed and a snail, placed in the absence of light.Explain the carbon dioxide exchange in an aquatic environment containing pondweed and a snail in the absence of light.","In the absence of light, the pondweed is unable to photosynthesize [1]. Therefore, carbon dioxide is not absorbed by the pondweed. Instead, carbon dioxide continues to be released as both the snail and the pondweed respire [1]."
"An aquatic environment containing pondweed and a snail, initially showing a yellow color with an indicator solution, is observed over several hours.Describe the expected color change of an indicator solution in an aquatic environment with pondweed and a snail over several hours, given it starts yellow.","The indicator solution changes color from yellow to red, and then to purple over the next few hours.

"General biological knowledge distinguishing types of variation, using examples of ground finch size and finch beak depth.Distinguish between continuous and discontinuous variation, using examples of 'size of ground finch' and 'beak depth' in finches.","Both continuous and discontinuous variations are observed. The size of ground finch exhibits discontinuous variation, as there are only 2 discrete or distinct phenotypes: small and medium [1]. Beak depth, however, is a continuous variation, as there are many values over a range, typically from 7 to 17 mm [1]."
"Data on finch beak depths shows that finches on Isabela Island have a beak depth range between 10 to 16.5 mm. In contrast, finches on Daphne Island have a narrower beak depth range between 8.5 to 11.5 mm. On Isabela Island, the highest percentage of finches has a beak depth of 12 mm, while on Daphne Island, it is 10 mm.Compare the beak depths of finches on Isabela Island and Daphne Island, and explain the origins of variation in beak depth.","Finches on Isabela Island have a larger range of beak depth, between 10 to 16.5 mm, while finches on Daphne Island have a narrower range of beak depth between 8.5 to 11.5 mm. The highest percentage of finches on Isabela Island has a beak depth of 12 mm, while on Daphne Island it is 10 mm [1]. The idea of mutation leads to variation. The ancestor or colonizer finches on Daphne Island have a range of beak depth due to random mutation or different combinations of alleles of one or several genes [1]."
"On Daphne Island, the available seeds are smaller compared to those on Isabela Island.Explain how natural selection has led to the prevalence of finches with shallower beaks on Daphne Island.","On Daphne Island, the primary selective pressure is the availability of smaller seeds compared to Isabela Island [1]. Finches with shallower beaks on Daphne Island possess a phenotypic trait that gives them an advantage: they are better able to feed on these smaller seeds, ensuring they have sufficient food to survive and reproduce [1]. This enables them to pass on their genes to their offspring [0.5], thereby increasing the population of finches with shallower beaks (8.5-11.5 mm) [1], making up a larger percentage of the finch population on the island. The overall idea is that they survive and reproduce [0.5] and pass on favourable genes [0.5], increasing the population with the selected trait [0.5]."
"General biological knowledge about human endocrine disorders.Define diabetes mellitus, specifically describing its physiological basis.",Diabetes mellitus is a condition whereby a person has persistently higher than normal blood glucose concentration [0.5] due to the body's liver and muscle cells' resistance to insulin or insufficient production of insulin [0.5].
"Following the definition of diabetes mellitus, consider the cellular effects of insulin resistance.Describe the cellular effects of insulin resistance in liver and muscle cells on blood glucose levels.","In conditions of insulin resistance, liver cells and muscle cells become less permeable to glucose [0.5], leading to less glucose being absorbed into these cells [0.5]. Additionally, the liver is not stimulated to convert excess glucose to glycogen for storage [0.5]. Consequently, excess glucose remains in the bloodstream [0.5]."
Considering the design of a study on blood glucose regulation.What initial conditions should be controlled or considered when conducting a study on blood glucose regulation?,"When conducting a study on blood glucose regulation, it is important to control for the blood glucose concentrations at the start, other health conditions of participants, and any other drugs being taken by participants."
"A study investigates the effectiveness of Metformin (Met) alone versus Metformin combined with treatment A (Met+A) or treatment B (Met+B) in reducing blood glucose. The study involved a total of 25-30 people, with different numbers of participants in each group. The results show that Met+A gives a lower percentage reduction in blood glucose than Met alone. Similarly, Met+B also gives a lower percentage reduction in blood glucose than Met alone.Evaluate a statement regarding the effectiveness of treatments A and B on blood glucose reduction compared to Metformin alone, considering the study design and results.","One should disagree with the statement. There are several reasons:
1.  (Met + A) gives a lower percentage reduction in blood glucose than Metformin alone, indicating the statement is not supported.
2.  (Met + B) also gives a lower percentage reduction in blood glucose than Metformin alone, further indicating the statement is not supported.
3.  The number of people used in the study (25-30) is not very large.
4.  The number of people in each group is different, which could affect the reliability of the comparison.

"General biological knowledge about ecosystems, decomposition, and nutrient cycling.Explain the role of microorganisms in the carbon cycle and energy flow within an ecosystem, particularly concerning dead plants.","Microorganisms play a crucial role by breaking down or digesting large molecules (like starch and cellulose) in dead plants, which contain carbon, into smaller molecules such as glucose [0.5]. These smaller molecules are then used as substrates for respiration by the microorganisms, producing carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere [0.5]. Regarding energy flow, not all the energy from the dead plants is transferred to the microorganisms [0.5]. Some energy is lost to the surroundings in the form of heat [0.5]. While this heat cannot be absorbed by living plants to carry out photosynthesis, the released carbon dioxide can be utilized again by plants for photosynthesis [1]."
General biological knowledge about the global carbon cycle and the properties of water.Explain the role of oceans in the global carbon cycle.,"Water in oceans acts as a solvent, allowing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to dissolve into it [1]. This dissolved carbon dioxide is then absorbed by aquatic plants and used for photosynthesis [1]."
General biological knowledge about embryonic development (placental structures) and the human digestive system (intestinal structures).Compare and contrast the structure and function of embryonic villi and intestinal villi.,"Embryonic villi begin to grow from the embryo into the uterine lining [1]. A comparison of embryonic villi and intestinal villi reveals several points of similarity and difference:

**Structure:**
1.  **Shape/Surface Area to Volume (SA:V):** Both embryonic villi and intestinal villi are finger-like projections designed to increase surface area for the movement of substances or diffusion [1]. Both are also one cell thick to decrease diffusion distance. (Note: The claim that 'both have microvilli' is rejected, as villus itself is the fold).
2.  **Types of vessels:** Both types of villi contain blood capillaries. However, intestinal villi also possess a lacteal, which is absent in embryonic villi [1]. (Note: The claim that 'villi have many folds' is rejected, as the villus *is* the fold).

**Function:**
3.  **Type of substances transported:** Both allow the movement of nutrients and water. However, embryonic villi additionally facilitate the movement of waste materials and antibodies.
4.  **Process of transport:** Both primarily move substances via diffusion. However, intestinal villi also actively transport glucose and amino acids.
5.  **Location of substance movement:** At embryonic villi, movement occurs between maternal and fetal blood. At intestinal villi, substances move from the lumen into the blood.
6.  **Direction of movement:** At intestinal villi, the movement of substances is typically unidirectional (absorption). At embryonic villi, the movement of substances occurs in two directions (exchange)."
"General biological knowledge about human blood groups and their compatibility for transfusions.Explain the principles of blood group compatibility for transfusions, including the roles of antigens and antibodies, and describe universal donor and recipient.","Antigens A or B are found on red blood cells, while corresponding antibodies (anti-A or anti-B) are found in the plasma [1]. In a transfusion, if complementary antibodies and antigens bind to each other, it causes agglutination or clumping of blood [1]. Therefore, for a safe transfusion, the donor's red blood cells cannot have antigens that are complementary to the antibodies in the recipient's plasma [1].

Regarding universal types:
*   **Universal Donor:** Donors can generally donate blood to recipients of the same blood group. Blood group O is considered the universal donor because its red blood cells have no A or B antigens, preventing agglutination in any recipient [1].
*   **Universal Recipient:** Recipients can generally receive blood from donors of the same blood group. Blood group AB is considered the universal recipient because its plasma contains no anti-A or anti-B antibodies, meaning it will not agglutinate red blood cells from any donor type [1]."

D relaxed, relaxed","Based on the visual representation in the diagram, at point 1, the longitudinal muscle lines are shown as bunched or compressed, indicating that the longitudinal muscles are contracted. At point 2, the longitudinal muscle lines appear stretched or elongated, indicating that the longitudinal muscles are relaxed. Therefore, the longitudinal muscles at 1 are contracted, and at 2 are relaxed."
"The diagram shows parts of the human alimentary canal and associated organs. Labeled structures are:

C
D","Most water absorption in the alimentary canal occurs in the small intestine, labeled B. While some water is absorbed in the large intestine, the vast majority of water, along with digested nutrients, is absorbed across the highly folded surface of the small intestine."
"The graph illustrates pressure changes in the left side of the human heart (left ventricle, aorta, left atrium) over one heartbeat cycle (time / s). The x-axis represents time in seconds from 0 to 0.8. The y-axis represents pressure in kPa from 0 to 20. The solid line represents aortic pressure, the dashed line represents left ventricular pressure, and the dotted line represents left atrial pressure. Point X is marked at approximately 0.35 seconds. At point X, both the left ventricular pressure (dashed line) and aortic pressure (solid line) are falling rapidly from their peaks and are approximately equal (around 8-10 kPa), with ventricular pressure slightly below aortic pressure. The left atrial pressure (dotted line) is low and slowly rising.Which valve is open and which is closed at the time marked X?
valve
bicuspid
semi-lunar
A closed, closed
B closed, open
C open, closed
D open, open","At time X (approximately 0.35 s), the left ventricular pressure has fallen below the aortic pressure, causing the semi-lunar (aortic) valve to close to prevent backflow into the ventricle. Simultaneously, the left ventricular pressure is still higher than the left atrial pressure (which is very low), so the bicuspid (mitral) valve, which is between the left atrium and left ventricle, remains closed. This period, where both the semi-lunar and bicuspid valves are closed, is known as isovolumetric relaxation, during which the ventricle relaxes without a change in volume."
"The table displays the movement of four substances (oxygen, carbon dioxide, amino acids, urea) between capillaries and tissues in a specific part of the body. A tick (✓) indicates that a substance passes in the specified direction.
- Oxygen: Passes 'out of the capillaries into the tissues'.
- Carbon dioxide: Passes 'into the capillaries from the tissues'.
- Amino acids: Passes 'out of the capillaries into the tissues'.
- Urea: Passes 'into the capillaries from the tissues'.
This pattern shows that the tissues are taking up oxygen and amino acids from the blood and releasing carbon dioxide and urea into the blood.In which part of the body are these capillaries?
A between the alveoli
B in the kidney
C in the liver
D in the villi","The pattern of substance exchange – oxygen and amino acids moving from capillaries into tissues, and carbon dioxide and urea moving from tissues into capillaries – is characteristic of metabolic activity in an organ. The liver (C) is a highly metabolic organ where cells consume oxygen and amino acids for various processes, and in turn produce carbon dioxide and urea (from amino acid metabolism) which are then released into the blood. This pattern fits the liver's functions."
"The graph shows how pressure and volume inside the lungs change during one complete breath. The x-axis represents time in seconds (0 to 3 s). The left y-axis represents lung volume in dm³ (2.0 to 2.5 dm³), shown by a dashed line. The right y-axis represents lung pressure, shown by a solid line. 
- The lung volume starts at approximately 2.2 dm³, increases to a peak at point B (approximately 2.5 dm³ at 1.5 s), and then decreases to point D (approximately 2.0 dm³ at 3 s).
- The lung pressure starts slightly above 0 kPa, drops to a minimum at point A (approximately 0 kPa at 0.5 s), then rises to a peak at point C (approximately 0.25 kPa at 2.2 s), before decreasing again.
Inhalation begins when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, leading to an increase in lung volume and a decrease in intra-pulmonary pressure, drawing air into the lungs.At which point are the muscles of the diaphragm starting to contract?
A
B
C
D","Inhalation is an active process that begins with the contraction of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. Muscle contraction leads to an increase in thoracic cavity volume and a consequent decrease in pressure inside the lungs, drawing air in. Point A represents the lowest pressure in the lungs, which occurs during the phase of active inhalation when the pressure gradient is maximized for air influx. The diaphragm muscles would start contracting at the very beginning of the inhalation phase, leading to this drop in pressure towards point A."
"The diagram shows a kidney dialysis machine. Blood flows from 'blood in' across a 'dialysis membrane' and exits as 'blood out'. Dialysis fluid flows in the opposite direction, from 'dialysis fluid in' to 'dialysis fluid out'. Various shapes represent molecules: unfilled circles, unfilled squares, unfilled triangles, filled circles, filled squares, and filled triangles.
- In the 'blood in' section, there is a high concentration of filled triangles, filled circles, and filled squares, along with some unfilled circles and squares.
- In the 'blood out' section, the number of filled triangles is significantly reduced, indicating they have been removed from the blood.
- The 'dialysis fluid in' section contains only unfilled circles and squares.
- The 'dialysis fluid out' section shows a high concentration of filled triangles, which have passed from the blood across the dialysis membrane into the dialysis fluid.Which shape represents urea?
A (unfilled circle)
B (filled circle)
C (unfilled square)
D (filled triangle)","Urea is a waste product that needs to be removed from the blood during dialysis. The diagram clearly shows that the filled triangles are abundant in the 'blood in' section, are nearly absent in the 'blood out' section, and have transferred in large quantities into the 'dialysis fluid out' section. This indicates that the filled triangles represent the molecule that is most efficiently removed from the blood and passed into the dialysis fluid, which is consistent with the function of dialysis to remove urea."
"The question asks about a mechanism for maintaining body temperature that involves the action of muscles. The options are detection of temperature, insulation with fatty tissue, shivering, and sweating.Which mechanism for maintaining body temperature involves the action of muscles?
A detection of temperature
B insulation with fatty tissue
C shivering
D sweating","Shivering (C) is a mechanism for thermoregulation that directly involves the action of muscles. It consists of rapid, involuntary contractions of skeletal muscles, which generate heat as a byproduct of increased metabolic activity, thereby helping to raise body temperature when the body is cold. Detection of temperature involves sensory receptors, insulation with fatty tissue reduces heat loss passively, and sweating cools the body through evaporation of water, not direct muscle action to generate heat."
"The diagram illustrates a negative feedback system for thermoregulation. The cycle shows: 'temperature rising' leads to 'more sweat secreted', which leads to 'temperature falling'. Conversely, 'temperature falling' leads to 'less sweat secreted', which leads to 'temperature rising'. This forms a closed loop where a change in temperature triggers a response that counteracts the initial change.Why is this a negative feedback system?
A It decreases the temperature blood.
B It increases any change in the temperature blood.
C It increases the temperature blood.
D It reverses any change in the temperature of blood.","A negative feedback system is characterized by its ability to reverse or counteract an initial change in a variable, thereby maintaining a state of balance or homeostasis. In this thermoregulation example, if body temperature rises, the system responds by increasing sweating to lower the temperature, thus reversing the initial rise. If temperature falls, sweating decreases, allowing temperature to rise again (or preventing further fall). Therefore, the system 'reverses any change in the temperature of blood'."

A blood
B Borrelia burgdorferi
C mouse
D tick","The pathogen is the specific agent that causes the disease. According to the flowchart, the 'bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi' are carried by the mouse, transferred to the tick, then to the human, and cause Lyme disease. Therefore, Borrelia burgdorferi (B) is the pathogen."

A 2
B 3
C 4
D 5","An organism that eats both plants and animals is called an omnivore. In this food web, organism 1 represents a plant (producer). Organism 2 is shown consuming organism 1, meaning it eats plants. If organism 2 is identified as the one that eats both plants and animals (an omnivore), it implies that it also consumes animals, even though the specific arrows depicting consumption of animals by organism 2 are not explicitly drawn in this simplified food web diagram. Organisms 3, 4, and 5 are either herbivores or carnivores as depicted by the existing arrows."
"In a molecule of DNA, the proportion of nitrogenous bases follows Chargaff's rules: the amount of adenine (A) is equal to the amount of thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G) is equal to the amount of cytosine (C). The total percentage of all four bases (A, T, G, C) in DNA is 100%. The given information is that 21.2% of the bases are cytosine.21.2% of the bases in a molecule of DNA are cytosine.

A 21.2%
B 28.8%
C 42.4%
D 57.6%","According to Chargaff's rules, the percentage of cytosine (C) is equal to the percentage of guanine (G). So, if C = 21.2%, then G = 21.2%. The combined percentage of C and G is 21.2% + 21.2% = 42.4%. The remaining percentage of bases must be adenine (A) and thymine (T): 100% - 42.4% = 57.6%. Since A = T, the percentage of adenine is 57.6% / 2 = 28.8%."

Cells from these tissues can be used for cloning to produce new plants that are genetically identical to the original plant."
"The question asks for a correct statement describing self-pollination in a plant. Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower, or to the stigma of another flower on the same plant.Which statement correctly describes self-pollination in a plant?
A It bears bisexual flowers with anthers and stigma maturing at different times.
B It bears bisexual flowers with anthers and stigma maturing at the same time.
C It needs no agent to transfer pollen, but pollination is unlikely.
D It needs two plants of the same species but there is little variation in the offspring.","For successful self-pollination within a single flower (autogamy), it is crucial that the anthers (which release pollen) and the stigma (which receives pollen) of that bisexual flower mature and become receptive at the same time. This synchronous maturation facilitates the transfer of pollen within the same flower. If they mature at different times (dichogamy), self-pollination within that flower is prevented or reduced."

A oviduct wall
B umbilical cord
C uterus wall
D vagina wall","The placenta is an organ that forms within the uterus during pregnancy. It implants into and attaches to the inner lining of the **uterus wall** (C).

C 50%
D 100%","The sex of each child is determined independently at the time of conception. Each pregnancy has approximately a 50% chance of resulting in a male child and a 50% chance of resulting in a female child. Previous children's sexes do not influence the probability of the sex of subsequent children. Therefore, the chance of his next child being a daughter is 50%."
"The graph displays a bell-shaped curve, which is characteristic of a normal distribution. The x-axis is labeled 'characteristic', and the y-axis is labeled 'frequency'.

A ABO blood groups in humans
B body length in humans
C seed colour in peas
D seed shape in peas","A bell-shaped curve indicates continuous variation, where a characteristic shows a wide range of phenotypes that blend into one another. 'Body length in humans' (B) is a characteristic that exhibits continuous variation, as individuals can have a wide range of heights, influenced by many genes and environmental factors. In contrast, 'ABO blood groups in humans' (A), 'seed colour in peas' (C), and 'seed shape in peas' (D) are examples of discontinuous variation, where characteristics fall into distinct categories, typically controlled by one or a few genes."
"Figure 1.1 is a graph showing the rate of carbon dioxide uptake or production (y-axis, in arbitrary units, with uptake being positive and production being negative) versus light intensity (x-axis, in arbitrary units). The origin (O) is at the point where both carbon dioxide uptake/production and light intensity are zero. There are two curves: one for a 'sun leaf' and one for a 'shade leaf'. The 'sun leaf' curve starts at a negative carbon dioxide production value at zero light intensity, rapidly increases to positive carbon dioxide uptake values, and then plateaus at a high uptake rate at high light intensities. The 'shade leaf' curve also starts at a negative carbon dioxide production value at zero light intensity, increases less rapidly than the sun leaf curve, and then plateaus at a lower positive carbon dioxide uptake rate compared to the sun leaf at high light intensities.Draw a line and letter X to label the light intensity at which the rate of respiration is equal to the rate of photosynthesis in the shade leaf on Fig. 1.1.","The point where the rate of respiration is equal to the rate of photosynthesis for the shade leaf is where its curve intersects the x-axis, as this is the point where there is no net carbon dioxide uptake or production.

The 'shade leaf' curve also starts at a negative carbon dioxide production value at zero light intensity, increases less rapidly than the sun leaf curve, and then plateaus at a lower positive carbon dioxide uptake rate compared to the sun leaf at high light intensities.With reference to Fig. 1.1, describe two ways in which the sun and shade leaf differ in their response to increasing light intensity.","Firstly, at higher light intensities, the sun leaf shows a significantly higher maximum rate of carbon dioxide uptake compared to the shade leaf. The sun leaf's curve plateaus at a much higher positive value on the y-axis. Secondly, the sun leaf's rate of carbon dioxide uptake increases more rapidly with increasing light intensity, while the shade leaf's rate increases less steeply and reaches its maximum uptake at a lower light intensity, indicating it is light-saturated earlier. Alternatively, at low light intensities, the shade leaf has a higher net carbon dioxide uptake or lower net carbon dioxide production compared to the sun leaf, as its curve is above the sun leaf curve in this region."
"Figure 1.1 shows the rate of carbon dioxide uptake or production for sun and shade leaves, with results taken at a temperature of 20°C. The graph indicates that photosynthesis, which involves enzyme-controlled reactions, is occurring.Fig. 1.1 shows the results taken at a temperature of 20°C. Describe the effect on the sun leaf if the temperature was increased to 25°C.","If the temperature is increased from 20°C to 25°C, the rate of photosynthesis in the sun leaf would generally increase. This is because photosynthesis involves enzyme-controlled reactions, and within this temperature range (up to the optimum temperature), an increase in temperature provides more kinetic energy to the reactant molecules, leading to more frequent successful collisions between enzymes and substrates, thus increasing the rate of chemical reactions and consequently, carbon dioxide uptake."
"Figure 2.1 is a circular diagram representing the series of events in a cardiac cycle of a man. The outer ring, labeled A to H, shows the sequence of events in the ventricles, while the inner ring, labeled a to h, shows events in the atria. The diagram indicates that each segment (e.g., A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) represents a duration of 0.1 seconds. A key is provided, where shaded regions represent systole (contraction) and unshaded regions represent diastole (relaxation).

The entire cardiac cycle consists of 8 such segments.Calculate the heart rate of the man in beats per minute. Show your working.","One complete cardiac cycle consists of 8 segments, and each segment lasts 0.1 seconds. Therefore, the duration of one cardiac cycle is 8 segments * 0.1 seconds/segment = 0.8 seconds.

Periods A, B, and C in the outer ring are shaded, indicating ventricular systole (contraction).Describe the events that occur in the heart during the period A to C.","During the period A to C, the ventricles are in systole, meaning their muscular walls contract. This contraction, starting at period A, causes a rapid increase in pressure within the ventricles. This increased pressure forces the semi-lunar valves (pulmonary and aortic valves) to open. Consequently, blood is ejected from the ventricles and rushes into the aorta from the left ventricle and into the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle."
An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a condition characterized by a small hole in the wall (septum) between the left and right atria of the heart.An atrial septal defect is a condition where there is a small hole found in the wall of the heart between the left and right atria. Suggest why doctors advise patients with atrial septal defect to avoid vigorous sports.,"Doctors advise patients with an atrial septal defect to avoid vigorous sports because the hole between the atria allows oxygenated blood from the left atrium to mix with deoxygenated blood in the right atrium. This mixing leads to a reduced overall oxygen content in the blood that is pumped to the body. During vigorous sports, the body's demand for oxygen increases significantly, and if the blood cannot supply sufficient oxygen due to the mixing, it can lead to symptoms like breathlessness, fatigue, and potential heart strain."
"Table 3 shows the concentration in blood of various substances for a patient undergoing kidney dialysis. For potassium, the concentration in blood is 4.3 mg/l at 0 hours, drops to 4.1 mg/l at 0.5 hours, and remains at 4.1 mg/l at 6 hours.Explain the results when t = 6 h for potassium.","At t = 6 hours, the concentration of potassium in the blood is 4.1 mg/l, which is the same as its concentration at t = 0.5 hours. This indicates that the concentration of potassium in the patient's blood has reached equilibrium with the concentration of potassium in the dialysis fluid (bath fluid). Therefore, there is no net movement of potassium between the blood and the dialysis fluid, and its concentration remains stable."
"Figure 4.1 illustrates a human placenta, which connects maternal and fetal tissues. The diagram explicitly states that maternal blood and fetal blood remain separate, even though there are 'blood spaces' within the placenta where exchange can occur between the mother and fetus via the umbilical vein and artery. The 'maternal artery' brings blood towards the placenta, the 'maternal vein' takes blood away, the 'umbilical vein' carries blood from placenta to fetus, and the 'umbilical artery' carries blood from fetus to placenta.State a reason why there must be no mixing of fetal and maternal blood.","There must be no mixing of fetal and maternal blood primarily because the mother and fetus may have different blood groups. If their blood types are incompatible, mixing could lead to agglutination (clumping) of fetal red blood cells, which can be fatal to the fetus. Additionally, the maternal circulatory system operates at a much higher blood pressure than the fetal circulatory system, and direct mixing could subject the delicate fetal blood vessels to damaging high pressure."
"The placenta is a vital organ that facilitates the exchange of substances between the mother and the fetus, while maintaining separate circulatory systems as shown in Figure 4.1, which depicts the maternal artery, maternal vein, blood spaces, umbilical vein, and umbilical artery. This exchange involves nutrients, gases, and waste products.The placenta is often described as “a small intestine, a lung and a kidney”. Explain how the placenta functions like the abovementioned organs. small intestine lung kidney","The placenta functions like a small intestine by allowing the diffusion of digested food substances, such as glucose, amino acids, and fats, from the mother's blood into the fetal blood. It acts like a lung by facilitating the transport of oxygen from the mother's blood to the fetal blood, and carbon dioxide from the fetal blood to the mother's blood for excretion. Lastly, it functions like a kidney by enabling the transport of urea and other nitrogenous waste products from the fetal blood into the mother's blood, which the mother's kidneys then excrete."

"In the inheritance of cat fur colour, the allele for yellow fur (A) is dominant to the allele for grey fur (a). A cross between two heterozygous yellow-coloured cats (Aa x Aa) yields offspring with a genotypic ratio of 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa and a phenotypic ratio of 3 Yellow : 1 Grey. A particular combination of these alleles is known as a 'lethal' combination, causing young to die in the uterus and resulting in a 2:1 ratio of fur colour in the surviving offspring.Identify the lethal combination of alleles and explain how you reached this answer. lethal combination explanation","Lethal combination: AA. Explanation: From the genetic cross of two heterozygous yellow-coloured cats (Aa x Aa), the expected genotypic ratio is 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow fur (AA, Aa) to 1 grey fur (aa). If the homozygous dominant genotype (AA) is the lethal combination, then these individuals would not survive. This would leave only the Aa (yellow fur) and aa (grey fur) individuals. The surviving offspring would then have a genotypic ratio of 2 Aa : 1 aa, which translates directly to a phenotypic ratio of 2 yellow fur : 1 grey fur, matching the described 2:1 ratio in the surviving offspring."
"Figure 7.1 illustrates an aquatic ecosystem. It shows an 'aquatic plant' which is consumed as 'food' by a 'fish'. The diagram also shows processes related to nitrogen cycling, where 'animal waste' from the fish and 'uneaten food' are converted to 'ammonium ions', then through process X to 'nitrite ions', and through process Y to 'nitrate ions', which are then absorbed by the 'aquatic plant'.Use the information in Fig. 7.1 to state the trophic level of aquatic plant trophic level of fish","The trophic level of the aquatic plant is producer (or first trophic level). The trophic level of the fish is primary consumer (or herbivore, second trophic level), as it consumes the aquatic plant."
"Figure 7.1 shows an aquatic ecosystem where a fish consumes aquatic plants for food. The diagram also implies other interactions within the ecosystem.Explain one way, other than for food, that the fish may depend on the aquatic plant.","Other than for food, the fish may depend on the aquatic plant for oxygen. Aquatic plants perform photosynthesis, releasing oxygen into the water, which the fish then uses for aerobic respiration. Alternatively, aquatic plants can provide shelter, hiding places from predators, or sites for fish to lay their eggs, thus supporting their reproductive cycle and survival."
Figure 7.1 shows an aquatic ecosystem where aquatic plants absorb nitrate ions. Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth.Describe the pollution effect that nitrogen-containing fertilizers might have on this ecosystem.,"Nitrogen-containing fertilizers, when introduced into this aquatic ecosystem, can lead to eutrophication. The increased supply of nitrogen, a limiting nutrient, would cause rapid growth and multiplication of algae and aquatic plants, leading to an 'algal bloom' or excessive plant growth on the water surface. This dense layer of surface growth blocks sunlight from reaching submerged aquatic plants, causing them to die. Subsequently, decomposers (bacteria and fungi) proliferate as they break down the dead organic matter. These decomposers carry out aerobic respiration, consuming large amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water. The reduced oxygen levels then lead to the death of other aquatic organisms, such as fish and other animals, creating a 'dead zone' in the ecosystem."

Its genes are typically found in pairs on homologous chromosomes. In contrast, in the bacterium (prokaryotic cell), the main genetic material is a single circular chromosome located in the cytoplasm (nucleoid region) without a nuclear membrane, and it also contains additional small, circular DNA molecules called 'DNA plasmids' in the cytoplasm. Bacterial genes are not typically found in pairs on homologous chromosomes."
"Figure 9.1, stage K, shows the isolation of an 'insulin gene' from human DNA and the isolation of a 'DNA plasmid' from a bacterium, which is then cut by a 'bacterial enzyme'. Stage J depicts the 'insulin gene inserted into the plasmid'.Describe how the events in stage K led to the production of J.","The events in stage K lead to the production of J through several steps. First, the human insulin gene is isolated from the human DNA. Simultaneously, a bacterial plasmid is extracted from the bacterium. The same specific restriction enzyme is used to cut both the isolated human insulin gene and the bacterial plasmid. This enzyme creates complementary 'sticky ends' on both the insulin gene and the cut plasmid. The isolated insulin gene then pairs with the complementary sticky ends of the open plasmid. Finally, the enzyme DNA ligase is used to form phosphodiester bonds, sealing the insulin gene into the plasmid, thus creating the recombinant DNA molecule labeled J (insulin gene inserted into the plasmid)."

Discuss the potential advantages and dangers of using genetic engineering to produce crop plants for humans to eat. advantages dangers","Advantages of using genetic engineering to produce crop plants for humans to eat include increased crop yield, leading to more profitable agriculture and a potential reduction in famine. Genetically modified (GM) crops can also be engineered to be resistant to diseases or pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides. Furthermore, they can be designed to grow in environmental extremes or in new areas, expanding agricultural land, or to have improved nutritional value, such as 'golden rice' with enhanced Vitamin A content. Dangers associated with GM crop plants include the potential for the introduced genes to spread to wild plant species through cross-pollination, leading to 'superweeds' or disrupting natural ecosystems. There are also concerns about potential long-term health risks to humans from consuming GM foods, such as allergic reactions or the introduction of new toxins, although scientific consensus generally supports their safety. Additionally, the patenting of GM seeds by large corporations can lead to increased costs for farmers and reduced biodiversity."
"Figure 10.1 illustrates the distribution of red scales (represented by small filled circles) and their predators (represented by circles with a cross) at three stages: 'before treatment', 'shortly after treatment', and 'long after treatment' with an insecticide. Before treatment: A moderate population of red scales is present along with a noticeable number of predators. Shortly after treatment: Both red scales and predators are drastically reduced in number. Long after treatment: The population of red scales has become extremely dense and numerous, far exceeding the initial numbers, while the predator population remains very low, much lower than its initial count.With reference to Fig. 10.1, explain why the use of insecticides is not the best way of destroying the red scales.","The use of insecticides is not the best way of destroying red scales because, as shown in Figure 10.1, while the insecticide initially reduces both red scale and predator populations ('shortly after treatment'), in the 'long after treatment' stage, the red scale population dramatically increases to a level far greater than before treatment, while the predator population remains very low. This suggests two main reasons: Firstly, the insecticide likely killed off the natural predators of the red scales. With fewer predators to control their numbers, the red scales experienced reduced selection pressure and were able to reproduce unchecked, leading to a population explosion. Secondly, some red scales might have possessed natural resistance to the insecticide due to genetic mutations. These resistant individuals survived the treatment, reproduced, and passed on their resistance, leading to a rapid increase in the population of insecticide-resistant red scales over time, rendering the insecticide ineffective and even exacerbating the pest problem."
"Figure 10.2 illustrates a sewage treatment plant with several stages: 'screen', 'grit pit' (1), 'sediment tank' (2), 'percolating filter' (3), 'digester' (4), and 'settling tank'. Raw sewage passes through the 'screen' then to the 'grit pit' (1). From there, it goes to the 'sediment tank' (2). The liquid from the sediment tank then goes to the 'percolating filter' (3). The 'effluent' from the percolating filter goes to the 'settling tank', which then releases the final 'effluent'. Sludge from both the 'sediment tank' (2) and the 'settling tank' is directed to the 'digester' (4).With reference to Fig. 10.2, describe the role of microorganisms in the treatment of sewage.","Microorganisms play a crucial role in the secondary and tertiary treatment stages of sewage, as depicted in Figure 10.2. In the 'percolating filter' (3), aerobic bacteria and fungi are present. As the sewage effluent trickles over the filter media, these microorganisms, under aerobic conditions (often maintained by pumping air), break down dissolved organic matter into simpler, less harmful inorganic substances through aerobic respiration. This process significantly reduces the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the effluent. Additionally, in the 'digester' (4), anaerobic microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) are used. Sludge, which comprises settled solids from the 'sediment tank' (2) and 'settling tank', is transferred to the digester. In the absence of oxygen, these anaerobic microorganisms secrete enzymes to break down complex organic compounds in the sludge into methane, carbon dioxide, and other byproducts. This reduces the volume of the sludge, stabilizes it, and destroys many harmful pathogens, making the treated sludge safer for disposal or beneficial use."
"The question asks about structures that possess both cytoplasm and a cell wall.Which of the following structures has both cytoplasm and cell wall? A root hair cell, B xylem vessel, C red blood cell, D platelet","A. A root hair cell is a type of plant cell, which characteristically possesses both cytoplasm and a cell wall. Xylem vessels are dead cells and lack cytoplasm. Red blood cells and platelets are animal cells, which lack a cell wall."
"The diagram is a flowchart illustrating different roles of membranes. It branches from 'membrane' to 'encloses cell contents / cell surface membrane' or 'encloses a structure within the cell'. From 'encloses a structure within the cell', it branches to 'possesses pores' or 'no pores present'. 'Possesses pores' leads to 'allows exit of mRNA (outcome 1)' and 'protein synthesis (outcome 2)'. 'No pores present' leads to 'single membrane' or 'double membrane'. 'Single membrane' leads to 'transports enzymes (outcome 3)' and 'lipid synthesis (outcome 4)'. 'Double membrane' leads to 'allows oxygen to enter (outcome 5)' and 'allows carbon dioxide to enter (outcome 6)'. The question asks to identify the organelles corresponding to outcomes 1, 3, 4, and 6.Which of the outcomes correctly identifies the organelles that possess the membrane and function concerned? outcome 1, outcome 3, outcome 4, outcome 6. A chloroplast, smooth ER, rough ER, mitochondrion. B nucleolus, vesicle, smooth ER, mitochondrion. C nucleus, vesicle, smooth ER, chloroplast. D nucleus, mitochondrion, rough ER, chloroplast.","C. Outcome 1, 'allows exit of mRNA', corresponds to the nucleus (specifically, its nuclear envelope which has pores). Outcome 3, 'transports enzymes', refers to vesicles, which are involved in transport within the cell. Outcome 4, 'lipid synthesis', is a primary function of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER). Outcome 6, 'allows carbon dioxide to enter', refers to the chloroplast, where carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis."
"The experiment involves a dish of agar jelly containing adipose tissue extracts (fats). Bromothymol blue, a pH indicator, turns yellow when the pH drops below 6. Four holes (A, B, C, D) are cut in the jelly and filled with different substances:
- Hole A: pancreatic juice
- Hole B: amylase
- Hole C: amylase with sodium hydroxide
- Hole D: bile
After 30 minutes, bromothymol blue is poured over the jelly.Which hole would be surrounded by the largest yellow region? A, B, C, D","A. Pancreatic juice (in hole A) contains lipase, which digests the fats in the adipose tissue extract into fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are acidic, causing the pH to decrease below 6, thus turning bromothymol blue yellow. Amylase (in hole B) digests starch, not fat. Amylase with sodium hydroxide (in hole C) would remain alkaline due to sodium hydroxide. Bile (in hole D) emulsifies fats but does not digest them into acidic products directly; pancreatic juice contains the enzyme responsible for digestion."
"The diagram displays the results of a chromatography experiment where products of five hydrolyzed disaccharides are separated. Reference spots are shown for 'fructose' (at a higher position), 'glucose' (below fructose), and 'sucrose' (at the start line). Four distinct results (1, 2, 3, 4) show different combinations of spots. Substances of the same identity travel equal distances from the start line.
- Result 1 shows spots corresponding to fructose and glucose.
- Result 2 shows a spot for fructose and another spot higher than fructose.
- Result 3 shows a single spot corresponding to glucose.
- Result 4 shows a spot for glucose and another spot higher than glucose.
Maltose is a disaccharide composed of two glucose units.Which result represents the hydrolysis of maltose? A 1, B 2, C 3, D 4","C. The hydrolysis of maltose yields two glucose molecules. Since substances of the same identity travel the same distance on a chromatogram, these two glucose molecules would appear as a single, concentrated spot at the glucose level. Result 3 shows only a single spot at the glucose level, indicating that only glucose was produced."
"The question lists four fluids from a healthy individual: 1 blood plasma, 2 saliva, 3 sweat, and 4 urine. The Biuret test is used to detect the presence of proteins, yielding a positive (purple) result if proteins are present.Which fluid(s) will produce a positive result with the biuret test? A 1 only, B 1 and 2, C 2 and 3, D 3 and 4","B. Blood plasma (1) contains numerous proteins such as albumin, globulins, and clotting factors. Saliva (2) contains enzymes like amylase, which are proteins. Therefore, both blood plasma and saliva would produce a positive result with the Biuret test. Sweat (3) and urine (4) from a healthy individual contain negligible amounts of protein, so they would typically yield negative results."
"The diagram shows a metabolic pathway in a bacterium where amino acids (1 to 6) are produced by specific enzymes (V, W, X, Y, Z). The pathway is: 1 --(V)--> 2 --(W)--> 4 --(Y)--> 6. Additionally, 2 --(X)--> 3 and 4 --(Z)--> 5. The original strain of bacterium requires only amino acid 1 and can produce all other amino acids using its enzymes. A mutant strain cannot synthesize some enzymes and can only survive when provided with amino acids 1, 2, and 5.Which enzymes were missing in the mutant strain? A X and X only, B V and Z only, C V, X and Z, D V, W and Z","B. The mutant strain requires amino acid 2 to survive, indicating it cannot synthesize amino acid 2 from amino acid 1. This means enzyme V (which converts 1 to 2) is missing. The mutant strain also requires amino acid 5, indicating it cannot synthesize amino acid 5. Since enzyme Z converts 4 to 5, enzyme Z must be missing. If 1, 2, and 5 are supplied, the mutant can use the supplied 2 to make 3 (via X) and 4 (via W), and then use 4 to make 6 (via Y). Therefore, enzymes V and Z are the ones missing."
"The question describes the action of muscles in the walls of the oesophagus during the process of pushing a bolus of food along. This process is known as peristalsis, which involves coordinated contraction and relaxation of longitudinal and circular muscles.How do the muscles, especially those in the walls of the oesophagus, act when pushing a bolus of food along? longitudinal muscles behind bolus, circular muscles behind bolus. A contract, contract. B contract, relax. C relax, relax. D relax, contract.","D. During peristalsis, to push a bolus of food along, the circular muscles *behind* the bolus contract to constrict the lumen and apply pressure, while the longitudinal muscles *behind* the bolus relax to allow the tube to narrow. Simultaneously, the circular muscles in front of the bolus relax, and the longitudinal muscles in front of the bolus contract, widening the lumen to receive the bolus."
"The diagram shows a cross-section of part of a tissue, including a capillary network and associated lymph vessel and tissue cells. Arrows indicate the movement of fluids. P is located at the arterial end of a capillary, where fluid is being pushed out into the surrounding tissue. Q is located at the venous end of a capillary, where fluid is reabsorbed. A is a point in the arterial end of the capillary, B is a point mid-capillary, C is within the lymph vessel, and D is a point in the venous end of the capillary.At which point is the pressure highest? A, B, C, D","A. Blood pressure (hydrostatic pressure) is highest at the arterial end of the capillary (point A) as blood enters from the arterioles, driven by the pumping action of the heart. As blood flows through the capillary, resistance causes the pressure to drop (e.g., at B and D). Pressure in the lymph vessel (C) is generally lower than in the capillaries."
"The diagram illustrates a dialysis machine, showing blood entering from the patient, flowing through a partially permeable dialysis tubing, and returning to the patient. Dialysis fluid flows in the opposite direction (counter-current) to the blood. The engineer's recommendations to improve efficiency are:
1.  reverse the direction of blood flow
2.  increase the rate at which dialysis fluid is replaced
3.  increase the length of the dialysis fluid by coiling it
4.  increase the diameter of the lumen of the dialysis tubing while keeping the thickness of the tubing membrane the same
Efficiency in dialysis relies on maximizing the rate of diffusion of waste products from blood to dialysis fluid, influenced by concentration gradient, surface area, and diffusion distance.Which of his recommendations will improve the efficiency of the dialysis process of a patient? A 1 and 3, B 2 and 3, C 1, 2 and 3, D 2, 3 and 4","D. Let's evaluate each recommendation:
1.  **Reverse the direction of blood flow:** The diagram already shows counter-current flow (blood and dialysis fluid flowing in opposite directions), which is the most efficient setup for maintaining a steep concentration gradient. Simply reversing blood flow without also reversing fluid flow would disrupt this, potentially making it co-current, which is less efficient. Therefore, this is unlikely to improve efficiency.
2.  **Increase the rate at which dialysis fluid is replaced:** Continuously supplying fresh dialysis fluid (with zero waste concentration) maintains a steep concentration gradient, driving faster diffusion of waste products from the blood. This *improves* efficiency.
3.  **Increase the length of the dialysis fluid by coiling it:** A longer dialysis tubing provides a greater surface area for diffusion and a longer time for exchange to occur. This *improves* efficiency.
4.  **Increase the diameter of the lumen of the dialysis tubing while keeping the thickness of the tubing membrane the same:** Increasing the diameter of the tubing lumen (effectively increasing its circumference) increases the surface area available for diffusion, assuming the length is constant. This *improves* efficiency. 
Thus, recommendations 2, 3, and 4 will improve efficiency."
"The diagram shows a kidney tubule (R) and associated blood vessels (P). P represents a peritubular capillary surrounding the renal tubule, and R represents a section of the renal tubule, most likely the proximal convoluted tubule, where significant reabsorption occurs. The arrow indicates movement from the tubule (R) back into the blood (P).Which substance is entirely reabsorbed from the fluid at R to the blood at P? A glucose, B salts, C urea, D water","A. In a healthy individual, all filtered glucose is actively reabsorbed from the renal tubule (specifically the proximal convoluted tubule, represented by R) back into the peritubular capillaries (represented by P). While salts and water are extensively reabsorbed, their reabsorption is regulated and not typically 100%. Urea is a waste product, and a significant portion is excreted, with only about 50% being reabsorbed."
"The question describes a two-organ system where 'organ 1' produces 'product 1', and 'organ 2' produces 'product 2'. It asks how negative feedback control of product 2 would be achieved in this system.How would negative feedback control of product 2 be achieved? A product 1 counteracts product 2, B product 1 reinforces the effect of product 2, C product 2 inhibits organ 1 and product 1 stimulates organ 2, D product 2 stimulates organ 1 and product 1 stimulates organ 2","C. Negative feedback control involves the output of a process inhibiting an earlier step in the process to reduce its own production. In this scenario, if product 1 stimulates organ 2 to produce product 2, then for negative feedback to occur, an increase in product 2 would need to inhibit organ 1, thereby reducing the production of product 1 and consequently reducing the stimulation of organ 2 and the production of product 2 itself. Option C perfectly describes this mechanism: 'product 2 inhibits organ 1 and product 1 stimulates organ 2'."
"The question asks which symptoms are common to both influenza (flu) and pneumococcus diseases (bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae). Both are respiratory diseases.Which symptoms are presented in both influenza and pneumococcus diseases? A fever and cough, B sore throat and fever, C vomiting and sore throat, D cough and shortness of breath","A. Both influenza (a viral respiratory infection) and pneumococcal diseases (like bacterial pneumonia) are acute respiratory illnesses that commonly present with systemic symptoms such as fever and respiratory symptoms like coughing. While other symptoms may vary in prevalence and severity, fever and cough are highly characteristic of both."
"The table presents data from a potometer experiment for a leafy shoot under four different environmental conditions (P, Q, R, S). For each condition, the 'distance travelled by the bubble / mm' and the 'time taken / min' are provided. The rate of transpiration is directly proportional to the rate of water uptake, which can be calculated as (distance travelled) / (time taken). Let's calculate the rates:
- Rate P = 8 mm / 1 min = 8 mm/min
- Rate Q = 12 mm / 2 min = 6 mm/min
- Rate R = 8 mm / 2 min = 4 mm/min
- Rate S = 9 mm / 1.5 min = 6 mm/minWhat can be concluded from the results? A Condition P is the brightest and condition R is the dimmest. B The light intensity under condition Q and condition S is the same. C The transpiration rates are the same under condition Q and condition S. D The transpiration rate is the highest under condition Q.","C. Based on the calculated transpiration rates:
- Rate P = 8 mm/min
- Rate Q = 6 mm/min
- Rate R = 4 mm/min
- Rate S = 6 mm/min
Option C states that 'The transpiration rates are the same under condition Q and condition S'. Both conditions Q and S have a calculated transpiration rate of 6 mm/min, which directly supports this conclusion from the results. Options A and B are inferences about light intensity, which is not directly measured. Option D is incorrect, as Condition P has the highest transpiration rate (8 mm/min), not Condition Q (6 mm/min)."
"The diagram illustrates a carbon cycle with four numbered circles representing different components: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Arrows show the movement of carbon compounds between these components. 
- Carbon flows from 4 to 1 (e.g., uptake).
- Carbon flows from 1 to 2 and from 1 to 3.
- Carbon flows from 2 to 3.
- Carbon flows from 1, 2, and 3 to 4 (e.g., release).
This pattern suggests a typical carbon cycle structure where: 1 = Plants (producers), 2 = Animals (consumers), 3 = Decomposers, 4 = Atmosphere (CO2 reservoir).Which of the following options correctly identifies the four circles? 1, 2, 3, 4. A animals, atmosphere, plants, decomposers. B atmosphere, animals, decomposers, plants. C decomposers, animals, atmosphere, plants. D animals, decomposers, plants, atmosphere.","D. Let's test option D: 1=animals, 2=decomposers, 3=plants, 4=atmosphere.
- Flow from 4 (atmosphere) to 3 (plants): Plants take CO2 from the atmosphere for photosynthesis. (Matches)
- Flow from 3 (plants) to 1 (animals): Animals consume plants. (Matches)
- Flow from 3 (plants) to 2 (decomposers): Dead plants are decomposed. (Matches)
- Flow from 1 (animals) to 2 (decomposers): Dead animals are decomposed. (Matches)
- Flow from 1 (animals) to 4 (atmosphere): Animals respire, releasing CO2. (Matches)
- Flow from 2 (decomposers) to 4 (atmosphere): Decomposers release CO2 during decomposition. (Matches)
- Flow from 3 (plants) to 4 (atmosphere): Plants respire, releasing CO2. (Matches)
This assignment of 1=animals, 2=decomposers, 3=plants, and 4=atmosphere correctly explains all the carbon flow pathways shown in the diagram."
"A mutation occurs in a DNA molecule where one nitrogenous base is substituted. The normal DNA sequence is A-G-C-A-T-G-G-A-T-C-C-T, and the mutant sequence is A-G-C-A-T-G-C-A-T-C-C-T. The seventh base changes from G to C. A table provides codons on the 'complementary strand' of DNA and their corresponding amino acids: AAG=Lysine, CTA=Leucine, GGA=Glycine, GTA=Valine, TAC=Tyrosine, TCG=Serine.

To determine the change in amino acid, we assume the given DNA sequences (Normal and Mutant) are the *template strands* for transcription. Therefore, the 'complementary strand' in the table refers to the *coding strand* of DNA (which has the same sequence as the mRNA, except T instead of U).

Normal template DNA: A G C | A T G | G A T | C C T
Corresponding complementary (coding) DNA codons: T C G | T A C | C T A | G G A
Using the table:
- TCG codes for Serine
- TAC codes for Tyrosine
- CTA codes for Leucine
- GGA codes for Glycine

Mutant template DNA: A G C | A T G | C A T | C C T
Corresponding complementary (coding) DNA codons: T C G | T A C | G T A | G G A
Using the table:
- TCG codes for Serine
- TAC codes for Tyrosine
- GTA codes for Valine
- GGA codes for GlycineWhat is the change in the amino acid? A leucine to valine, B lysine to glycine, C glycine to lysine, D valine to leucine","A. By comparing the normal and mutant DNA sequences, the mutation occurs in the third codon, where the 'G' in 'GAT' (normal template) is replaced by 'C' in 'CAT' (mutant template). 

For the normal sequence, the third codon on the complementary (coding) strand is 'CTA', which codes for Leucine. 

For the mutant sequence, the third codon on the complementary (coding) strand is 'GTA', which codes for Valine. 

Therefore, the change in the amino acid is from Leucine to Valine."
"The mass of DNA in a normal diploid body cell in G1 phase is defined as Z. The question asks for the amount of DNA present in a cell after completion of mitosis, after completion of meiosis (resulting in a gamete), and in an egg after completion of fertilisation.How much DNA will be present in a cell after the completion of mitosis, after completion of meiosis and in an egg after completion of fertilisation? after completion of mitosis, after completion of meiosis, in an egg after completion of fertilisation. A Z/2, Z, Z. B Z, 2Z, 2Z. C Z, Z/2, 2Z. D 2Z, Z/2, Z.","D. 
1.  **After completion of mitosis:** If a normal body cell in G1 has Z amount of DNA, it replicates its DNA during S phase to 2Z. After mitosis, each daughter cell typically returns to the G1 phase with Z DNA. However, if 'after completion of mitosis' refers to the state of the cell *after DNA replication (G2/M phase)* but *before complete cytokinesis* into separate daughter cells (where the total DNA content for the replicated cell is still considered), the amount of DNA would be 2Z. This interpretation is often used in such comparative questions.
2.  **After completion of meiosis:** A cell starts with 2Z DNA after replication. Meiosis I separates homologous chromosomes, resulting in two cells, each with Z DNA (haploid chromosome number, but duplicated chromatids). Meiosis II separates sister chromatids, resulting in four haploid cells (gametes), each with Z/2 DNA. So, a cell (gamete) after completion of meiosis contains Z/2 DNA.
3.  **In an egg after completion of fertilisation:** A haploid egg (Z/2 DNA) fuses with a haploid sperm (Z/2 DNA) during fertilisation. The resulting diploid zygote will have Z DNA.
Therefore, the correct sequence is 2Z, Z/2, Z."
"The question states that haemophilia is a condition where blood does not clot, caused by a recessive allele inherited only on the X chromosome.What causes haemophilia? A iron-deficient diet, B loss of blood following an accident, C a change in chromosome number, D a change in the structure of a gene","D. Haemophilia is explicitly described as being caused by a 'recessive allele inherited on the X chromosome'. An allele is a variant form of a gene, and a mutation (a change in the DNA sequence) leads to different alleles. Therefore, a change in the structure of a specific gene (in this case, on the X chromosome) is the underlying cause. An iron-deficient diet causes anemia (A), loss of blood is a symptom, not a cause (B), and a change in chromosome number (C) refers to conditions like aneuploidy, which is different from a single gene mutation."
"The diagram displays parts of a flower with four labeled structures: P (anther), Q (petal), R (stigma), and S (sepal). The question asks to match these structures to their respective functions: protects developing bud, production of gametes, receives pollen grains, and attracts pollinators.Which of the following matches the structures to the correct function? protects developing bud, production of gametes, receives pollen grains, attracts pollinators. A Q, P, R, S. B Q, R, P, S. C S, R, P, Q. D S, P, R, Q.","D. Let's match each function to the correct structure:
-   **Protects developing bud:** Sepals (S) form the outermost whorl of a flower, enclosing and protecting the bud before it opens.
-   **Production of gametes:** Anthers (P) are part of the stamen and produce pollen grains, which contain the male gametes.
-   **Receives pollen grains:** The stigma (R) is the receptive tip of the pistil/carpel, where pollen lands during pollination.
-   **Attracts pollinators:** Petals (Q) are typically brightly colored and/or scented to attract insects or other animals for pollination.
Therefore, the correct match is S, P, R, Q."
"The diagram shows the male reproductive system with four labeled structures: A (urethra), B (vas deferens/sperm duct), C (seminal vesicle), and D (testis). The question asks which of these structures is responsible for secreting nutrients and enzymes to activate sperms.Which structure is responsible for secreting nutrients and enzymes to active sperms? A, B, C, D","C. The seminal vesicles (C) are a pair of glands that secrete a significant portion of the seminal fluid (semen). This fluid is rich in fructose, which provides nutrients (energy) for sperm motility, and also contains prostaglandins and other substances that contribute to sperm activation and viability. The testis (D) produces sperm, the vas deferens (B) transports sperm, and the urethra (A) is involved in urine and semen expulsion."
"The diagram illustrates two flowers on Plant X and one flower on Plant Y, both belonging to the same species. Four arrows (A, B, C, D) indicate different types of pollen transfer:
-   Arrow A: Pollen transfer from an anther to the stigma within the *same flower* on Plant X.
-   Arrow B: Pollen transfer from an anther of one flower on Plant X to the stigma of *another flower* on the *same Plant X*.
-   Arrow C: Pollen transfer from an anther of a flower on Plant X to the stigma of a flower on *Plant Y*.
-   Arrow D: Pollen transfer from an anther of a flower on Plant Y to the stigma of a flower on *Plant X*.Which transfer of pollen will bring about cross pollination? A, B, C, D","D. Cross-pollination (also known as xenogamy or allogamy) is the transfer of pollen from the anther of a flower of one plant to the stigma of a flower of *another plant* of the same species. 
-   Arrow A represents autogamy (self-pollination within the same flower).
-   Arrow B represents geitonogamy (self-pollination between flowers on the same plant, though sometimes considered cross-pollination in ecological terms).
-   Arrows C and D both represent pollen transfer between different plants (Plant X and Plant Y). Therefore, both C and D bring about cross-pollination. In a multiple-choice question where only one option can be selected and both C and D are valid examples, option D is chosen as an example of cross-pollination."
"Pectin, a type of carbohydrate, is one of the components of plant cell walls and is essential for maintaining their structure. Tomatoes are firm when unripe but soften during ripening due to the hydrolysis of these cell wall components by enzymes, including polygalacturonase. The activity of polygalacturonase involves converting pectin into mono-galacturonate.Using the 'lock and key' hypothesis, describe the action of polygalacturonase.","According to the 'lock and key' hypothesis, polygalacturonase acts as the lock, and pectin acts as the key. The active site of polygalacturonase has a specific 3D shape that is complementary to the shape of pectin. Pectin fits into and binds to the active site of polygalacturonase to form an enzyme-substrate complex. This binding lowers the activation energy of the reaction. The reaction then takes place at the active site, converting pectin into mono-galacturonate. The mono-galacturonate products then leave the active site, making it available to bind with the next substrate molecule."
"Pectin, a carbohydrate, is a component of plant cell walls, maintaining cell structure. Tomatoes soften during ripening due to the hydrolysis of pectin by enzymes like polygalacturonase. Polygalacturonase activity converts pectin to mono-galacturonate and is triggered by ethylene, a gas released by ripening fruits. An experiment showed that ethylene concentration affects the ripening time of tomatoes.It is often advised that ripening bananas should not be placed together with other ripe fruits. Using the information provided in the question, suggest why this is so.","Ripening bananas release ethylene gas. Ethylene triggers the activity of polygalacturonase, an enzyme that causes fruits to soften by breaking down pectin in their cell walls. If ripening bananas are placed with other ripe fruits, the ethylene they release will accelerate the ripening process in the other fruits, causing them to over-ripen, soften excessively, and potentially spoil more quickly."

"Auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) is a condition where carbohydrates are converted into alcohol in the digestive tract by fungi or bacteria through fermentation, which occurs in anaerobic conditions. Individuals with severe ABS have elevated blood alcohol levels and symptoms of alcohol intoxication. This condition can lead to liver failure over time.Suggest how patients with ABS can manage their blood alcohol levels to reduce the likelihood of liver failure.","To manage blood alcohol levels and reduce the likelihood of liver failure, patients with Auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) should consume less carbohydrates, as carbohydrates are the substrate for the fermentation process by fungi or bacteria in the digestive tract that produces alcohol."
"Autosomal dominant compelling helio-ophthalmic outburst (ACHOO) syndrome causes uncontrollable sneezing when individuals are suddenly exposed to bright light. Sneezing involves the contraction of various muscles, including the diaphragm, abdominal muscles, and muscles at the back of the throat.Explain the nervous pathway when an individual with ACHOO syndrome is exposed to bright light and sneezes.","When an individual with ACHOO syndrome is exposed to bright light, the increase in light intensity is detected by photoreceptors on the retina, which generate a nerve impulse. This nerve impulse is then transmitted along sensory neurones in the optic nerve. The impulse crosses a synapse with the help of neurotransmitters to reach a relay neurone in the brain. From there, the nerve impulse is transmitted to motor neurones, which then carry the impulse to the effector muscles, specifically the diaphragm muscle, abdominal muscles, and muscles at the back of the throat. These effector muscles then contract, causing the sneezing reflex."
"Autosomal dominant compelling helio-ophthalmic outburst (ACHOO) syndrome causes uncontrollable sneezing when individuals are suddenly exposed to bright light. A couple, both with ACHOO syndrome, had a child without the syndrome, indicating they are heterozygous (Aa) carriers. A genetic cross between two heterozygous parents (Aa x Aa) would produce offspring genotypes in the ratio 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa, meaning 3 out of 4 offspring would have ACHOO syndrome (AA or Aa) and 1 out of 4 would not (aa).The couple decided to have another child. Calculate the probability that they will have a baby girl with ACHOO syndrome.","Based on the genetic cross Aa x Aa, the probability of any child having ACHOO syndrome (AA or Aa) is 3/4. The probability of having a baby girl is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that they will have a baby girl with ACHOO syndrome is (3/4) × (1/2) = 3/8, or 0.375."

The x-axis shows 'days before ovulation' (from 5 days before to the day of ovulation itself), and the y-axis shows 'percentage probability of pregnancy / %' (ranging from 0% to 45%). The data points are as follows: 5 days before ovulation shows approximately 5% probability; 4 days before ovulation shows approximately 10%; 3 days before ovulation shows 20%; 2 days before ovulation shows approximately 35%; 1 day before ovulation shows approximately 40%; and on the day of ovulation, the probability is approximately 25%.The study shows a probability of 20% that sexual intercourse three days before ovulation will result in pregnancy. State how many times more likely pregnancy is if sexual intercourse takes place two days later?","According to Fig. 4.1, the probability of pregnancy three days before ovulation is 20%. Two days later would be one day before ovulation. At one day before ovulation, the probability of pregnancy is 40%. Therefore, pregnancy is (40% / 20%) = 2 times more likely if sexual intercourse takes place two days later."
"The study investigated the probability of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse on specific days of the menstrual cycle, showing that the probability of pregnancy is highest just before ovulation (1 day before ovulation) and decreases significantly further away from ovulation.Explain the role of a named hormone in the menstrual cycle during the days investigated by this study.","During the days investigated (the follicular phase leading up to ovulation), estrogen plays a crucial role. Estrogen stimulates the repair and thickening of the uterine lining (endometrium), preparing it for potential implantation of an embryo. Furthermore, a high concentration of estrogen triggers the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, which in turn leads to ovulation, the release of a mature egg from the ovary."
"No specific context provided, only the question related to the effect of smoking during pregnancy.A woman smoked while she was pregnant. Explain how this will affect oxygen transport to the fetus.","When a pregnant woman smokes, carbon monoxide (CO) from the cigarette smoke enters her bloodstream. Carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen, binding irreversibly to it to form carboxyhaemoglobin. This reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the mother's red blood cells. Consequently, less oxygen is transported across the placenta to the fetus via the umbilical cord, leading to reduced oxygen supply for fetal development."
"No specific context provided, only the question related to glucose transport in a pregnant woman.Describe the transport of glucose from when it was first absorbed in a pregnant woman's small intestine to when it reaches the fetus, including named organs and blood vessels.","After absorption in the small intestine, glucose enters the capillaries in the villi and is then transported by the blood plasma. This glucose-rich blood travels via the hepatic portal vein to the liver. In the liver, some glucose may be processed or stored, while the rest enters the hepatic vein. From the hepatic vein, the blood flows into the vena cava and then enters the heart. The heart pumps this blood, now part of the systemic circulation via the aorta, towards the placenta. At the placenta, glucose diffuses from the maternal blood across the placental barrier into the fetal blood. It is then carried by the umbilical vein to the fetus."
"Young grass plants were grown with roots in a mineral solution containing nitrate ions. Plants were divided into batch N and batch P. Batch P had cyanide added to its solution, which inhibits aerobic respiration. The mean quantity of nitrate ions in each plant was measured for 70 hours. After 60 hours, the mineral solution was replaced with distilled water. Fig. 5.1 is a graph showing the mean quantity of nitrate ions in each plant (mg) on the y-axis (0 to 60 mg) versus time (hours) on the x-axis (0 to 80 hours). For batch N, the quantity of nitrate ions increases linearly from 0 mg at 0 hours to 56 mg at 60 hours, then decreases. For batch P, the quantity increases to about 10 mg at 10 hours and then plateaus until 60 hours, after which it decreases.Using the data in Fig. 5.1, calculate the rate of absorption of nitrate ions in batch N at time = 40 hours. Show your working.","From Fig. 5.1, the graph for batch N shows a linear increase in the quantity of nitrate ions from 0 hours to 60 hours. To find the rate of absorption at 40 hours, we can calculate the gradient of this linear segment. We can pick two points on the linear portion, for example, (0 hours, 0 mg) and (50 hours, 40 mg). 

Working:
Rate of absorption = (Change in quantity of nitrate ions) / (Change in time)
Rate = (40 mg - 0 mg) / (50 hours - 0 hours)
Rate = 40 mg / 50 hours
Rate = 0.8 mg/h"
"Young grass plants were grown in a mineral solution containing nitrate ions. They were divided into two batches, N and P. Cyanide, which inhibits aerobic respiration, was added to the mineral solution for batch P. Batch N did not receive cyanide. Fig. 5.1 shows that plants in batch N absorbed nitrate ions steadily, reaching a high quantity, while plants in batch P absorbed much less, with the quantity plateauing early. Specifically, Batch N reached 56 mg at 60 hours, while Batch P reached about 10 mg at 10 hours and then plateaued until 60 hours.Explain why the absorption of nitrate ions by the plants in batch N differs from that in batch P.","In batch P, cyanide was added to the mineral solution, which inhibits aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is necessary to produce ATP (energy) required for active transport. Without sufficient ATP, the plants in batch P cannot actively transport nitrate ions against their concentration gradient into the root cells. Therefore, absorption in batch P mainly relies on diffusion, which is a passive process that ceases when an equilibrium is reached, resulting in a much lower and plateaued quantity of absorbed nitrate ions. In contrast, plants in batch N are able to perform aerobic respiration, generating ATP. This energy enables active transport to occur, allowing nitrate ions to be moved from an area of lower concentration (the mineral solution) to an area of higher concentration (within the root cells), resulting in a higher rate and greater quantity of nitrate ion absorption compared to batch P."
"Fig. 5.1 shows the mean quantity of nitrate ions in each plant over time. After 60 hours, the mineral solution containing nitrate ions was replaced with distilled water. Following this, the mean quantity of nitrate ions in both batches N and P decreased.The mean quantity of nitrate ions in both batches of plants decreased after 60 hours. State the process responsible for this decrease.",The process responsible for the decrease in the mean quantity of nitrate ions in both batches of plants after 60 hours is diffusion.
"After 60 hours, the mineral solution for both plant batches N and P was replaced with distilled water, which contains no nitrate ions. The mean quantity of nitrate ions in both batches of plants then decreased, a process attributed to diffusion.Explain how the process stated in (c)(i) resulted in the decrease.","After 60 hours, the mineral solution was replaced with distilled water, which has a zero concentration of nitrate ions. The concentration of nitrate ions inside the plant root cells (in the cell sap) was significantly higher than in the surrounding distilled water. Due to this concentration gradient, nitrate ions moved out of the root cells into the distilled water by diffusion, passing through the partially permeable cell surface membrane. This net movement of nitrate ions out of the plant cells resulted in the observed decrease in the mean quantity of nitrate ions in both batches of plants."
"The human eye contains photoreceptors (rod and cone cells) to detect light. Rod cells detect low intensity light for night vision in shades of grey, while cone cells detect high intensity light for colour and sharp vision. Fig. 6.1 shows a diagram of the eye, indicating angles from the fovea where recordings were made. The fovea is located at 0 degrees, and the blind spot is located around -20 degrees from the fovea.State the part of the eye that refracts light the most.",The cornea is the part of the eye that refracts light the most.
"Fig. 6.1 presents a diagram of an eye with angular measurements from the fovea, along with a graph showing the distribution of rod cells and cone cells across the retina. On the eye diagram, the fovea is indicated at 0 degrees, and the blind spot is shown at approximately -20 degrees from the fovea, where the optic nerve leaves. The graph illustrates the number of rod cells and cone cells per mm² on the y-axis, against the angle from the fovea in degrees on the x-axis, ranging from -70 to +70 degrees. Box A on the graph is positioned above 0 degrees, corresponding to the fovea, while Box B is positioned above approximately -20 degrees, corresponding to the blind spot.Identify the parts of the eye A and B represent in Fig. 6.1 by filling in the boxes.",A represents the fovea. B represents the blindspot.
"Fig. 6.1 is a graph showing the number of rod cells and cone cells across the retina (per mm²) versus the angle from the fovea in degrees (from -70 to +70 degrees). The graph indicates that at the fovea (0 degrees), there is a maximum concentration of cone cells (approx. 150,000 cells/mm²) and virtually no rod cells. Rod cell numbers are lowest at the fovea and peak at about 20-21 degrees from the fovea (approx. 160,000 cells/mm²), gradually decreasing towards the periphery. Cone cell numbers drop sharply away from the fovea. At approximately -20 degrees (corresponding to the blind spot), both rod and cone cells are absent.Use Fig. 6.1 to describe the distribution of rod cells and cone cells across the retina.","At the fovea (0 degrees from the fovea), there is a maximum number of cone cells, reaching approximately 150,000 per mm², and virtually no rod cells are present. Moving away from the fovea, the number of cone cells rapidly decreases and becomes very sparse in the peripheral retina. Conversely, the number of rod cells is very low or absent at the fovea but increases significantly away from it, peaking at approximately 20-21 degrees from the fovea, where they reach a maximum of about 160,000 cells per mm². The number of rod cells then gradually decreases towards the extreme periphery of the retina. Additionally, at the blind spot (around -20 degrees from the fovea), there is a complete absence of both rod cells and cone cells."
The optic nerve is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain.State the type of neurone found in the optic nerve.,The type of neurone found in the optic nerve is a sensory neurone.
"The optic nerve contains sensory neurones, which are responsible for transmitting information from the eye.Explain the function of the neurone stated in (c)(i).","The sensory neurones found in the optic nerve transmit nerve impulses. These impulses are generated by the photoreceptors (rod and cone cells) in the retina after they detect light. The impulses are then carried from the eye to the brain, where they are interpreted as visual information."

This organism is depicted as a rod-shaped single-celled structure with a cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, and several appendages including flagella (long whip-like structures for movement) and pili (hair-like structures for attachment). It also contains genetic material in the form of a circular chromosome and small circular extrachromosomal DNA elements.Identify the type of pathogen shown in Fig. 7.1.",The type of pathogen shown in Fig. 7.1 is a bacterium.
"No specific context provided, only the question regarding the evolution of viruses versus humans.“Viruses are able to evolve faster than humans, hence humans will eventually succumb to the ever-evolving viruses and go extinct.” Discuss the validity of this statement.","The statement is largely invalid, although viruses do present significant challenges. Humans do not primarily overcome viruses by genetic evolution in the same way viruses mutate; instead, they rely on their adaptive immune system and medical advancements. The human immune system, specifically its adaptive immunity, produces antibodies that are capable of recognizing and neutralizing new strains of viruses. Memory cells provide long-term immunity and a rapid response upon re-infection. Furthermore, medical science rapidly develops vaccines to provide protection before infection and antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases. These mechanisms allow humans to adapt to new viral strains within a relatively short timeframe, unlike the slower pace of human genetic evolution. However, the statement contains a partial validity because some viruses are indeed highly mutation-prone, such as the influenza virus or HIV, allowing them to rapidly develop new antigens that evade existing immune responses or vaccines. This rapid evolution can make it challenging for the immune system and medical science to keep pace, potentially leading to widespread illness and, in extreme cases, the possibility of severe pandemics. However, global extinction due to viruses is highly unlikely given the multifaceted defense mechanisms and adaptive capabilities of the human species, both biologically and medically."
"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they cannot replicate independently and require a host cell for reproduction. They hijack the host cell's machinery to synthesize their components.Describe how the virus makes use of named human cell components to synthesise viral proteins needed for the virus' assembly.","Upon infecting a human host cell, the virus introduces its genetic material (either DNA or RNA) into the cell. If it's viral DNA, it uses the host cell's RNA polymerase, located in the nucleus, to transcribe its genes into viral messenger RNA (mRNA). If it's viral RNA, it may directly serve as mRNA or be used as a template to synthesize mRNA. This viral mRNA then moves out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the viral mRNA attaches to the host cell's ribosomes. The ribosomes then read the genetic code on the viral mRNA and, through the process of translation, synthesize specific sequences of amino acids to form polypeptide chains, which are the viral proteins. These newly synthesized viral proteins may then undergo further processing, packaging, and modification within the host cell's Golgi apparatus before being assembled into new virus particles."
"Rice, maize, and wheat plants produce carbohydrates through photosynthesis, using light energy, water, and carbon dioxide from the environment. These plants are a major carbohydrate source for over 60% of the human population.Besides carrying out the process stated in 8(b), discuss the roles these plants play in the carbon cycle in terms of the removal and release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.","Besides photosynthesis, these plants play crucial roles in the carbon cycle regarding both the removal and release of carbon dioxide. For carbon dioxide removal, during photosynthesis, they convert atmospheric CO2 into organic carbon compounds, storing it within their biomass. When these plants are consumed by other organisms (e.g., humans or herbivores), the carbon compounds are transferred along food chains, temporarily sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Additionally, if these plants die and their organic matter is buried under specific geological conditions over long periods, they can form fossil fuels, effectively trapping carbon underground for millions of years. For carbon dioxide release, these plants continuously undergo cellular respiration, breaking down organic compounds to release energy, which consequently releases CO2 back into the atmosphere. When these plants die, decomposers (like bacteria and fungi) break down their organic matter, also releasing CO2 through their respiration. Furthermore, if these plants or plant-derived products (such as biofuels) are burned, the stored carbon is released as CO2 into the atmosphere through combustion."
"Globally, deforestation is occurring at a rate that outpaces reforestation, leading to a net loss of five million hectares of forests annually.Describe the consequences of deforestation on animals that live in the forests.","Deforestation has severe consequences for animals living in forests. Firstly, it results in the direct loss of habitat, destroying the physical space and resources animals need to survive. This habitat destruction leads to a significant loss of biodiversity, as many species are unable to adapt or relocate. Animals also experience decreased food availability because the trees and plants that serve as their primary food sources or support their prey are removed. This can disrupt entire food chains and food webs within the ecosystem. Consequently, animal populations may decrease due to starvation, lack of shelter, or increased predation. Many animals are forced to migrate to unfamiliar territories, facing increased competition for resources and higher mortality rates. For species with highly specialized habitat requirements or limited geographic ranges, deforestation can directly lead to endangerment or even extinction."
"Fig. 9.1 shows an image of a tropical rainforest floor, featuring shorter plants referred to as shrubs, which thrive in dark and humid environments under the forest canopy. Deforestation involves the removal of the top canopy of rainforests, which exposes these understory shrubs to altered environmental conditions.Explain how deforestation will affect the rate of transpiration in these shrubs.","Deforestation, by removing the top canopy of rainforests, significantly alters the microclimate around the shrubs, thereby affecting their rate of transpiration through several factors. Firstly, the removal of the canopy leads to increased light intensity reaching the forest floor. Higher light intensity stimulates the stomata on the shrubs' leaves to open wider, increasing the surface area for water vapor escape and thus accelerating transpiration. Secondly, exposure to direct sunlight and reduced shading increases the ambient temperature around the shrubs. Elevated temperatures increase the kinetic energy of water molecules, leading to a faster rate of evaporation from the wet surfaces within the leaf and a higher rate of diffusion of water vapor out of the stomata. Thirdly, the canopy previously created a humid environment by trapping moisture. Its removal reduces atmospheric humidity, creating a steeper water vapor concentration gradient between the saturated air inside the leaf and the drier external atmosphere. This steeper gradient drives a faster diffusion of water vapor out of the leaves, increasing transpiration. Lastly, the canopy acted as a windbreak. Deforestation exposes the shrubs to higher wind speeds, which quickly sweep away the humid air layer (boundary layer) immediately surrounding the leaves. This continuous removal of humid air maintains a steep water vapor concentration gradient, further enhancing the rate of transpiration. Collectively, these changes in light intensity, temperature, humidity, and wind speed will lead to a substantial increase in the rate of transpiration in these shrubs."
"Fig. 1.1 shows a diagram of a leaf. A magnified section of the lower surface of the leaf is shown, indicating different cell types. Three parts are labeled: P, Q, and R. P points to a large, irregularly shaped epidermal cell on the surface. Q points to one of two bean-shaped cells, known as guard cells, that flank an opening. R points to the opening itself, which is a stoma, located between the two Q cells (guard cells). These structures are located on the lower surface of the leaf.Fig. 1.1 shows the lower surface of a leaf. Label P, Q and R.","P is the Epidermal cell, Q is the Guard cell, and R is the Stoma."
"Fig. 1.2 shows enlarged diagrams of Cell Q (guard cell) from Fig. 1.1, in two states: 'swollen' and 'shrunken'. Both diagrams show internal structures including Chloroplasts (oval structures), a Vacuole (large central area), a Cell Wall (outer boundary), and a Nucleus (small circular structure). In the 'swollen' state, the guard cell is plump and curved, causing the gap between two guard cells to be 'open'. In the 'shrunken' state, the guard cell is less plump, and the gap between two guard cells is 'closed'. The cell wall appears thicker on the inner side (adjacent to the stoma) and thinner on the outer side. During the day, potassium pump moves K+ ions into Cell Q from surrounding cells, and at night the potassium pump removes K+ ions out of Cell Q into surrounding cells. Structure R refers to the stoma, the opening between the guard cells.(i) During the day, potassium pump moves K+ ions into Cell Q from surrounding cells while at night the potassium pump removes K+ ions out of Cell Q into surrounding cells. Describe and explain how that helps structure R to remain open or close. Open Close:","Open: During the day, the potassium pump moves K+ ions into Cell Q (guard cell). This lowers the water potential of the guard cell, causing water molecules to move into the guard cell by osmosis from surrounding cells. This makes the guard cells turgid, causing them to bow outwards and open structure R (the stoma). Close: At night, the potassium pump removes K+ ions out of Cell Q (guard cell). This increases the water potential of the guard cell, causing water molecules to move out of the guard cell by osmosis. This makes the guard cells flaccid (or plasmolysed), causing them to straighten and close structure R (the stoma)."
"Fig. 1.2 shows enlarged diagrams of Cell Q (guard cell) in 'swollen' and 'shrunken' states. The diagram labels Cell Wall, Chloroplast, Vacuole, and Nucleus. The cell wall is shown to be of unequal thickness, appearing thicker on the side facing the stoma and thinner on the outer side. In the 'swollen' state, the cell is curved, making the stoma 'open'. In the 'shrunken' state, the cell is less curved, making the stoma 'closed'.(ii) Describe and explain how Cell Q is adapted for its function.","Cell Q (guard cell) has a cell wall of unequal thickness, specifically thicker on the inner side (adjacent to the stoma) and thinner on the outer side. This rigid cell wall allows the cell to expand more on the thinner outer side and less on the thicker inner side when it becomes turgid, causing it to bow outwards and open the stoma. Conversely, when it loses turgor, it straightens, closing the stoma. Additionally, the guard cell contains chloroplasts for photosynthesis to produce sugars, which can be converted to starch, influencing water potential, and has a large central vacuole for water storage, facilitating turgor changes."
"Cell Q refers to a guard cell, which is involved in regulating the opening and closing of stomata in plants. The question asks to compare and contrast how coordination and responses are different in animals and plants using Cell Q as an example.(iii) Using Cell Q as an example, compare and contrast how coordination and responses are different in animals and plants.","Both animals and plants, exemplified by Cell Q (guard cell), have the ability to respond to stimuli. However, animals coordinate responses rapidly via a nervous system, transmitting electrical impulses to effectors like muscles, leading to fast and complex actions. Plants, on the other hand, lack a nervous system and typically respond more slowly, coordinating changes through hormones or, as in the case of Cell Q, by altering turgor pressure in their cells, which leads to physical changes like opening or closing of the stoma. This plant response is generally slower and less complex than animal responses."
The question asks for an explanation of how oxygen travels from the alveoli to muscle cells and its subsequent use within those cells.(b) Explain how oxygen reaches a muscle cell from the alveoli and how it is used by the muscle cells.,"Oxygen from the alveoli diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and the surrounding capillaries into the blood plasma and then into red blood cells. There, it binds with haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin. This oxygen-rich blood is transported by the pulmonary veins to the heart, which then pumps this oxygenated blood through the arteries to the body tissues, including muscle cells. At the muscle cells, oxygen diffuses from the capillaries into the cells, where it is used as a reactant in aerobic respiration. In aerobic respiration, glucose is completely broken down with oxygen to release a large amount of energy, which the muscle cells primarily use for contraction and other metabolic activities."
The question asks to explain the cellular events that occur in a muscle cell when it experiences a lack of oxygen.(c) Explain what happens in a muscle cell when it lacks oxygen.,"When a muscle cell lacks sufficient oxygen, it switches from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration. In anaerobic respiration, glucose is incompletely broken down without oxygen, releasing significantly less energy compared to aerobic respiration. This process also produces lactic acid as a byproduct. The accumulation of lactic acid in muscle cells lowers the pH, leading to muscle fatigue, tiredness, and can cause muscle cramps or pain."
"The question notes that oxygen availability is lower at higher altitudes compared to low altitudes. It asks for suggestions of modifications in the circulatory and respiratory systems that would help people who have lived for many years at high altitude to adapt.(d) At higher altitude, oxygen is less available than it is at low altitudes. Suggest modifications of the circulatory and respiratory systems that might help people that live for many years at high altitude.","People living at high altitudes for many years may develop several physiological modifications to cope with lower oxygen availability. In the respiratory system, this could involve an increased breathing rate and deeper breaths to take in more air, along with potentially increased lung capacity or more efficient lung structure to maximise oxygen absorption. In the circulatory system, there could be an increase in the number of red blood cells and a higher concentration of haemoglobin within them, leading to a greater oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. The heart may also become larger and its muscles thicker, enabling it to pump blood more efficiently and increase blood flow and circulation rate, ensuring oxygen is delivered more effectively to organs and tissues."
"Fig. 3.1 shows a 'ghost plant' growing near a 'neighbouring tree'. The ghost plant has roots that intertwine with the tree root, and a 'Fungus' is shown connecting the ghost plant root to the tree root, with an arrow indicating 'flow of nutrients from tree to ghost plant'. The accompanying text states that the ghost plant is completely white in colour and its cells do not contain chloroplasts.(a) Explain why the ghost plant needs to have fungi for the flow of nutrients.","The ghost plant needs fungi for the flow of nutrients because its cells do not contain chloroplasts. This means it cannot perform photosynthesis to produce its own carbohydrates (sugars) and other organic nutrients. Therefore, it relies on obtaining these nutrients from other organisms, specifically the neighbouring tree. The fungi act as a crucial link, forming a mycorrhizal association that facilitates the transfer of nutrients, primarily carbohydrates, from the tree's roots to the ghost plant's roots."
"Fig. 3.1 includes a magnified diagram of the 'Flower of the ghost plant'. The diagram illustrates that the stigma and anthers of the flower appear to be enclosed within the flower structure, not pendulous or openly exposed. The ghost plant itself is described as being 'completely white in colour' and having 'small, white, scale-like leaves'.(b) From the appearance of the flower, suggest how this plant is pollinated.","Based on the appearance of the flower, the ghost plant is likely pollinated by insects or is self-pollinated. The stigma and anthers appear to be enclosed within the flower, which is characteristic of insect-pollinated or self-pollinated flowers, as it protects the pollen and stigma, and does not rely on wind dispersal. The small, white colour of the flowers could also serve to attract insects for pollination."
"Fig. 3.2 shows a potato plant grown from a tuber. The diagram labels a 'stem', 'underground stem', 'developing tuber', 'tuber', 'young tuber', 'roots', and 'old seed potato'. The diagram shows the underground stem extending horizontally from the main stem, with tubers forming and swelling along it. The text states: 'Potatoes can reproduce asexually by means of tubers. The parent plant produces underground stems, which eventually form tubers.'(c) With reference to Fig. 3.2, describe how tubers are formed from the underground stems in potatoes.","With reference to Fig. 3.2, tubers in potatoes are formed from the underground stems. Sucrose, produced during photosynthesis in the leaves, is transported via the phloem to these underground stems. Once in the underground stems, the sucrose is converted into starch and stored. This accumulation of starch causes the underground stems to swell and thicken, forming new tubers. The diagram explicitly shows the 'underground stem' leading to 'developing tuber' and 'young tuber', illustrating this swelling process."
"Fig. 4.1 shows two varieties of Biston betularia moths on light-coloured tree bark: one is pale speckled, the other is black. The text states that equal numbers of both varieties (100 pale speckled, 100 black) were released into a forest with light-coloured bark. Table 4.2 presents data after two weeks: for 'pale, speckled' moths, 87 were caught, and for 'black' moths, 34 were caught.(a) Account for the difference in the number of varieties of moths caught, in relation to the colour of the bark.","From the data in Table 4.2, a significantly lower number of black moths (34 out of 100) were caught compared to pale, speckled moths (87 out of 100) after being released into a forest with light-coloured bark. This difference indicates that more black moths were consumed by predators. The pale, speckled moths are camouflaged against the light-coloured bark, making them less visible to predators. Conversely, the black moths stand out distinctly against the light-coloured bark, making them more easily spotted and preyed upon."
"In the early 19th century, most moths were pale speckled. By 1895, industrial factories caused widespread sooty black smoke, resulting in 95% of the moth population becoming black. The question asks to describe and explain the phenomenon that led to this change.(c) In the early 19th century, the moth were mostly pale speckled wing. By 1895, due to factories that covered the land with sooty black smoke, 95% of the moths were black. Describe and explain what leads to the phenomenon described in the above paragraph.","In the early 19th century, pale speckled moths were predominant because they were well camouflaged against the light-coloured tree bark, making them less visible and thus less susceptible to predation. With the rise of industrialisation by 1895, factories emitted soot and black smoke, which blackened the tree bark. Against this new dark background, the pale speckled moths became conspicuous and were more easily eaten by predators. Conversely, the black moths, which were previously visible, now became camouflaged against the blackened bark. As a result, the black moths had a higher survival rate, enabling them to reproduce more successfully and pass on their alleles for black pigmentation to the next generation. This process of natural selection led to an increase in the frequency of the black allele in the moth population. Over time, the population shifted, and the proportion of black moths significantly increased, becoming 95% of the population by 1895, a phenomenon known as industrial melanism."

The question asks for the name of the process that transports the bolus to the stomach.(b) Name the process that will carry the bolus to the stomach.",The process that will carry the bolus of food to the stomach is called peristalsis.
"Fig. 5.1 labels C as the epiglottis, a flap of cartilage at the root of the tongue that covers the opening of the larynx. Fig. 5.2 shows a bolus of food being swallowed. The question asks to describe and explain what happens to structure C when the person swallows the bolus.(c) Describe and explain what happens to structure C when the person swallows the bolus.","When a person swallows a bolus of food, structure C, the epiglottis, moves downwards and folds over the opening of the trachea (windpipe) and larynx (structure B). This action is often assisted by the upward movement of the larynx. The purpose of this movement is to close off the airway, preventing the bolus of food from entering the respiratory system (trachea and lungs) and instead directing it into the oesophagus, thus preventing choking."
John suffers from high blood pressure. His doctor advised him to reduce his intake of salt and water to prevent potential kidney failure. The question asks to explain the reasons behind this medical advice.(d) John suffers from high blood pressure and his doctor advised him to reduce his intake of salt and water in case it leads to kidney failure. Explain why his doctor advised him to reduce intake of water and salt.,"John was advised to reduce water and salt intake because high blood pressure can damage the delicate blood vessels in the kidneys, particularly the glomeruli, which are essential for ultrafiltration. Reducing water intake helps to decrease the overall volume of blood. A lower blood volume directly leads to a decrease in blood pressure, which in turn reduces the strain on the kidney's blood vessels and minimises further damage to the glomeruli, thus preserving kidney function. Regarding salt, consuming less salt lowers the concentration of solutes in the blood. This prevents the blood's water potential from becoming too low, which would otherwise stimulate the release of more Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH). Increased ADH would lead to greater reabsorption of water by the kidneys, increasing blood volume and subsequently elevating blood pressure, further risking kidney damage. Therefore, reducing both water and salt intake is crucial to manage blood pressure and protect kidney health."

Fig. 7.1 shows a simple food chain: 'tree' (producer) -> 'caterpillar' (primary consumer) -> 'bird' (secondary consumer). The question asks to describe and explain how a carbon atom from the atmosphere can become part of a glycogen molecule in the bird.(a) Describe and explain how a carbon atom in the atmosphere can become part of a glycogen molecule in the bird.,"A carbon atom, initially present in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2), can become part of a glycogen molecule in a bird through the following steps, tracing the food chain:
1.  **Photosynthesis in the Tree**: Atmospheric carbon dioxide diffuses into the leaves of the tree through stomata. It then dissolves in the thin film of moisture surrounding the mesophyll cells and enters these cells. Within the chloroplasts of the mesophyll cells, the carbon atom is incorporated into glucose molecules during photosynthesis, using light energy.
2.  **Conversion in the Tree**: Some of this glucose is then used by the tree to synthesize other organic compounds, including amino acids (by combining glucose derivatives with nitrates absorbed from the soil) and proteins, which are essential for the tree's growth and development, forming its protoplasm.
3.  **Consumption by the Caterpillar**: The caterpillar, which feeds on the tree's leaves, ingests these organic compounds, including proteins, from the tree.
4.  **Digestion and Synthesis in the Caterpillar**: In the caterpillar's digestive system, the tree's proteins are broken down into amino acids. These amino acids are then absorbed and used by the caterpillar to synthesize its own proteins for growth and repair, forming its own body cells.
5.  **Consumption by the Bird**: The bird preys on and consumes the caterpillar, ingesting the caterpillar's body, which contains its proteins.
6.  **Digestion and Synthesis in the Bird**: In the bird's digestive system, the caterpillar's proteins are digested back into amino acids. These amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream.
7.  **Deamination and Glycogen Formation in the Bird**: If there is an excess of amino acids, they undergo deamination in the liver, where the amino group is removed (forming urea), and the remaining carbon-containing keto acid is converted into glucose. This newly formed glucose, if not immediately used for energy, is then converted into glycogen, a storage polysaccharide, primarily in the bird's liver and muscles.
Thus, a carbon atom from atmospheric carbon dioxide has been incorporated into a glycogen molecule within the bird."
The question asks to describe and explain a known commercial application of genetic engineering and how it benefits humans.(a) Describe and explain using a known commercial application of genetic engineering and how it benefits human.,"A prominent commercial application of genetic engineering is the mass production of human insulin for treating Type 1 diabetes. This process, known as recombinant DNA technology, involves:
1.  **Isolation of Human Insulin Gene**: The specific gene responsible for producing human insulin is first isolated from human DNA.
2.  **Vector Preparation**: A plasmid (a small, circular DNA molecule found in bacteria) is extracted from a bacterium, and its DNA is cut open using specific restriction enzymes. This creates ""sticky ends"" that are complementary to those of the human insulin gene.
3.  **Gene Insertion and Ligation**: The isolated human insulin gene is then inserted into the opened plasmid. The sticky ends of the human gene and the plasmid anneal, and the enzyme DNA ligase seals the gaps, forming a recombinant plasmid (a plasmid containing foreign DNA).
4.  **Transformation**: These recombinant plasmids are then introduced into host bacteria, which are typically *E. coli*. The bacteria are now genetically modified or ""transgenic.""
5.  **Mass Culture and Production**: The transgenic bacteria are then cultured in large bioreactors or fermenters, where they multiply rapidly. As the bacteria reproduce, they also express the inserted human insulin gene, producing large quantities of human insulin.
6.  **Purification**: The human insulin is then harvested and purified for medical use.

This application significantly benefits humans by:
*   **Providing a Safe and Abundant Supply**: Before genetic engineering, insulin was extracted from the pancreases of pigs and cattle. This method was expensive, yielded limited quantities, and could sometimes cause allergic reactions or immune responses in patients due to slight structural differences from human insulin. Genetically engineered human insulin is identical to natural human insulin, reducing adverse reactions and providing an almost unlimited, reliable supply.
*   **Reduced Disease Transmission**: Using bacteria to produce human insulin eliminates the risk of transmitting animal diseases or allergens to human patients, which was a concern with animal-derived insulin.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: The large-scale bacterial culture makes the production of insulin more cost-effective, increasing its accessibility for the millions of people worldwide suffering from Type 1 diabetes."
"Fig. 1.1 is a bar chart that displays the volume of water lost per hour (in cm³) for two different plant species, A and B, under two temperature conditions: cool temperature and hot temperature. The y-axis, labeled 'volume of water loss / cm³ per hour', ranges from 0 to 9 cm³/hour in increments of 1. The x-axis is labeled 'plant species', showing discrete bars for species A and species B. The key indicates that light grey bars represent 'cool temperature' and dark grey bars represent 'hot temperature'. For plant species A, the water loss at cool temperature is 1 cm³/hour, and at hot temperature, it is 5.8 cm³/hour. For plant species B, the water loss at cool temperature is 4.8 cm³/hour, and at hot temperature, it is 6.8 cm³/hour.Compare the volume of water loss in species A and species B.","Comparing the volume of water loss: 1. Species B consistently lost more water than species A in both conditions; at cool temperature, B lost 4.8 cm³/hour compared to A's 1 cm³/hour, and at hot temperature, B lost 6.8 cm³/hour compared to A's 5.8 cm³/hour. 2. Both species lost significantly more water in hot conditions than in cool conditions; for species A, water loss increased from 1 cm³/hour to 5.8 cm³/hour, and for species B, it increased from 4.8 cm³/hour to 6.8 cm³/hour. 3. The difference in water loss between hot and cool temperatures was greater for species A (5.8 - 1 = 4.8 cm³/hour) than for species B (6.8 - 4.8 = 2.0 cm³/hour)."
"Fig. 1.1 is a bar chart showing the volume of water lost per hour (in cm³) for two different plant species, A and B, under two temperature conditions: cool temperature and hot temperature. For plant species B, the water loss at cool temperature is 4.8 cm³/hour. The experiment is now repeated for species B with increased humidity, while maintaining a cool temperature. Increased humidity reduces the water potential gradient between the plant and the atmosphere.Draw one additional bar on Fig. 1.1, for species B only, to show the expected result.","The expected result for species B under conditions of increased humidity and cool temperature would be a volume of water loss that is less than its original cool temperature value of 4.8 cm³/hour. This is because increased humidity reduces the water potential gradient between the plant and the surrounding atmosphere, thereby decreasing the rate of transpiration and subsequent water loss."

"Fig. 2.1 displays two photomicrographs of a cross-section of the trachea. The left image, at low magnification, shows the overall structure of the trachea, with a large central open space labeled A, which is the lumen where air travels. Surrounding the lumen, there are several distinct layers. B is a layer immediately adjacent to the inner surface of the tracheal lumen. C is a layer situated between layer B and the structural support rings. E is a prominent, C-shaped ring, which forms part of the structural framework of the trachea. D points to a gland cell located within the tracheal wall.

B:, C:, E:","B: Cilia (or ciliated epithelium). Its function is to beat dust-trapped mucus upwards and out of the airway, preventing foreign particles from reaching the lungs. C: Mucus. Its function is to trap particles and pathogens that enter the airway, preventing them from causing infection. E: Cartilage (specifically a C-shaped ring of cartilage). Its function is to provide structural support to the trachea, keeping the airway open and patent, preventing it from collapsing during inhalation and exhalation."
"The question pertains to the structure and function of alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs involved in gas exchange.Suggest why alveoli have thin walls.","Alveoli have thin walls to facilitate efficient gas exchange. The thinness of the walls creates a very short diffusion distance for respiratory gases, allowing oxygen to rapidly diffuse from the alveoli into the blood and carbon dioxide to rapidly diffuse from the blood into the alveoli for exhalation."

"A farmer wanted to breed disease-resistant apple trees as part of a selective breeding programme. He specifically decided not to use heterozygous disease-resistant apple trees (genotype Rr, where R is disease-resistant and r is not disease-resistant) for this programme.The farmer wanted to breed disease-resistant apple trees. He decided not to use heterozygous disease-resistant apple trees in his selective breeding programme. Explain why.","The farmer decided not to use heterozygous disease-resistant apple trees (Rr) because, although they are disease-resistant themselves, they carry the recessive allele 'r' for 'not disease-resistant'. If these heterozygous trees were used in breeding, there would be a chance that some of their offspring would inherit two recessive 'r' alleles (rr), resulting in offspring that are not disease-resistant. This would undermine the goal of the selective breeding programme, which aims to produce uniformly disease-resistant apple trees, and could lead to economic losses for the farmer."
"The farmer's goal was to ensure that only selected disease-resistant apple trees reproduced, implying a need for controlled pollination methods.The farmer wanted to be sure that only the selected disease-resistant apple trees would reproduce. Suggest what the farmer could do to ensure that only the selected apple trees were pollinated.","To ensure that only selected disease-resistant apple trees were pollinated, the farmer could undertake several measures. This includes performing artificial pollination by manually transferring pollen from selected trees to other selected trees. Additionally, the farmer could isolate the selected plants by planting them away from other apple trees, or by covering the flowers of the selected trees with bags to prevent unwanted pollen from reaching them. Another strategy would be to identify and remove any non-disease resistant apple trees from the vicinity to eliminate sources of undesirable pollen."
"The question asks to compare artificial selection and natural selection, which are fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology. Artificial selection involves human intervention, while natural selection occurs without direct human influence.Describe how artificial selection differs from natural selection.","Artificial selection differs from natural selection in several key ways. Firstly, artificial selection is driven by human choice, where individuals with desirable traits are intentionally bred by humans, whereas natural selection is driven by environmental pressures, favoring individuals that are better adapted to their specific habitat. Secondly, artificial selection tends to lead to reduced genetic diversity and variation within a population, as specific traits are preferentially selected for, while natural selection often maintains or can increase genetic variation, as a wider range of traits may offer advantages in a fluctuating environment. Lastly, artificial selection can result in much faster evolutionary changes because humans actively and rapidly select for specific traits, in contrast to natural selection, which is typically a slower, more gradual, and somewhat random process."
"Fig. 6.1 compares red blood cells from a healthy person and a person with sickle cell anaemia. Healthy red blood cells are described as biconcave shape, elastic, non-sticky, with a lifespan of 120 days. Red blood cells from a person with sickle cell anaemia are described as crescent shape, non-elastic, sticky, with a lifespan of 10 to 20 days. Fig. 6.2 illustrates the flow of these cells through a blood vessel. In a healthy person, biconcave cells flow smoothly. In a person with sickle cell anaemia, the crescent-shaped cells are shown clumping together and obstructing the blood vessel.Use information from Fig. 6.1 and Fig. 6.2 to suggest why the transport of oxygen to tissues is reduced in a person with sickle cell anaemia.","The transport of oxygen to tissues is reduced in a person with sickle cell anaemia for several reasons, as shown in the figures. Firstly, the red blood cells have a crescent shape instead of the normal biconcave shape (Fig. 6.1). This altered shape reduces their surface area, making them less efficient at carrying and absorbing oxygen. Secondly, these sickle cells are non-elastic and sticky (Fig. 6.1), causing them to clump together and obstruct blood vessels (Fig. 6.2). This blockage reduces blood flow to the tissues, significantly impairing oxygen delivery. Thirdly, sickle cells have a drastically shorter lifespan of only 10 to 20 days compared to 120 days for healthy red blood cells (Fig. 6.1). This leads to chronic anaemia, meaning fewer red blood cells are available in the blood to transport oxygen, further reducing oxygen supply to the body's tissues."
"A group of scientists investigated the total mass of carbon dioxide released when animals and plants are farmed and then used as food for humans. This investigation considered CO2 released during two phases: first, during the production of the food by farming, and second, after the food had left the farm and before it was eaten.Suggest and explain how human activity may result in the release of carbon dioxide after food has left the farm on which it was produced.","After food has left the farm, various human activities can contribute to carbon dioxide release. These include: 1. **Transport:** Trucks, ships, and airplanes used to transport food from farms to processing plants, supermarkets, and consumers burn fossil fuels, releasing CO2. 2. **Processing and Packaging:** Industrial processes involved in preparing, preserving, and packaging food (e.g., canning, freezing, baking) require significant energy, often derived from burning fossil fuels. 3. **Refrigeration and Storage:** Maintaining food freshness in warehouses, supermarkets, and homes requires energy for refrigeration, leading to CO2 emissions from electricity generation. 4. **Cooking:** Preparing food at home or in restaurants involves cooking processes that consume energy (e.g., electricity, gas), contributing to CO2 release. 5. **Food Waste:** When food is wasted and decomposes in landfills, it can produce methane (a potent greenhouse gas) and also carbon dioxide through aerobic decomposition, or if incinerated, CO2 is directly released. Energy is also expended in transporting and managing this waste."
"Table 7.1 shows the mass of carbon dioxide released per kilogram of food produced for various food items: beef (27.0 kg CO2/kg), salmon (11.9 kg CO2/kg), chicken (6.9 kg CO2/kg), eggs (4.8 kg CO2/kg), potatoes (2.9 kg CO2/kg), rice (2.7 kg CO2/kg), beans (2.0 kg CO2/kg), and tomatoes (1.1 kg CO2/kg). A farmer considers changing production from beef to tomatoes.A farmer decides to change production from beef to tomatoes. Calculate the percentage change in carbon dioxide released per kg of food produced.","To calculate the percentage change: 
Initial CO2 released (beef) = 27.0 kg/kg 
Final CO2 released (tomatoes) = 1.1 kg/kg 

Change in CO2 released = Initial CO2 - Final CO2 = 27.0 - 1.1 = 25.9 kg/kg 

Percentage change = (Change in CO2 / Initial CO2) × 100% 
Percentage change = (25.9 / 27.0) × 100% = 95.9259...% 

Therefore, the percentage change in carbon dioxide released per kg of food produced is approximately 95.9%."
"Table 8.1 shows experimental data for temperature change over time for three test-tubes (A, B, C) designed to model heat loss from animals. All test-tubes were initially filled with water at 70°C. Temperature readings were taken every 2 minutes over a 10-minute period.
- Tube A (representing a single animal) shows temperatures: 70°C at 0 min, 63°C at 2 min, 54°C at 4 min, 47°C at 6 min, 44°C at 8 min, 36°C at 10 min.
- Tube B (representing a central animal in a group) shows temperatures: 70°C at 0 min, 69°C at 2 min, 69°C at 4 min, 68°C at 6 min, 68°C at 8 min, 67°C at 10 min.
- Tube C (representing an outer animal in a group) shows temperatures: 70°C at 0 min, 68°C at 2 min, 66°C at 4 min, 64°C at 6 min, 62°C at 8 min, 60°C at 10 min.
The instruction requires plotting this data on a grid with 'time / minutes' on the x-axis and 'temperature / °C' on the y-axis.On the grid below, plot the results for the three test-tubes A, B and C on the same axes.","The plot would feature three distinct lines on a graph. The x-axis would be labeled 'time / minutes' ranging from 0 to 10 minutes, and the y-axis would be labeled 'temperature / °C', ideally ranging from 30°C to 70°C to accommodate all data points. Each line would connect the following points:
- **Line A:** (0, 70), (2, 63), (4, 54), (6, 47), (8, 44), (10, 36). This line would show the steepest decrease in temperature.
- **Line B:** (0, 70), (2, 69), (4, 69), (6, 68), (8, 68), (10, 67). This line would show the most gradual decrease in temperature, staying relatively high.
- **Line C:** (0, 70), (2, 68), (4, 66), (6, 64), (8, 62), (10, 60). This line would show a moderate decrease in temperature, steeper than B but less steep than A.
All three lines would be clearly identified, either through direct labels or a legend."
"Table 8.1 presents the temperature data for three test-tubes (A, B, C) over a 10-minute period, starting at 70°C. Tube A's temperature decreased from 70°C to 36°C. Tube B's temperature decreased from 70°C to 67°C. Tube C's temperature decreased from 70°C to 60°C.Describe and compare the temperature changes in test-tubes A, B and C.","All three test-tubes (A, B, and C) demonstrated a decrease in temperature over the 10-minute duration. Test-tube A experienced the most significant and rapid temperature drop, falling from 70°C to 36°C, representing a 34°C change. In contrast, test-tube B exhibited the smallest and slowest temperature decrease, only dropping from 70°C to 67°C, a mere 3°C change, indicating the lowest rate of heat loss. Test-tube C showed an intermediate rate of temperature decrease, from 70°C to 60°C, a 10°C change, meaning it lost more heat than B but substantially less than A. This comparison clearly shows that the arrangement of test-tubes significantly impacted their rates of cooling."
"Fig. 9.1 is a diagram illustrating a cross-section of the human eye focusing on a distant object. The diagram shows parallel light rays entering the eye from a distant object (represented by an arrow). Inside the eye, the light rays pass through a lens, which appears relatively thin and flat. The ciliary muscle is depicted as relaxed, meaning it is expanded and positioned further away from the lens. The suspensory ligaments, which connect the ciliary body to the lens, are shown as taut or tight, pulling on the lens. The light rays are focused by the lens onto the retina (labeled). The point labeled X is on the retina.Describe the roles of the ciliary muscles and suspensory ligaments in focusing on a distant object, as shown in Fig. 9.1.","As shown in Fig. 9.1, when the eye focuses on a distant object: 1. The ciliary muscles relax. This causes them to expand, increasing the diameter of the ring formed by the ciliary body. 2. Due to the relaxation and expansion of the ciliary muscles, the suspensory ligaments, which are attached to the ciliary body and the lens, become taut, tight, or tensed. 3. These taut suspensory ligaments pull on the edges of the lens. 4. This pulling force causes the elastic lens to become thinner, flatter, and less convex in shape. 5. A thinner, flatter lens has a longer focal length and thus refracts light less powerfully, allowing the parallel light rays originating from the distant object to converge precisely on the retina, forming a sharp image."
"Fig. 9.2 is an incomplete diagram of an eye, showing an object (a small human figure) positioned close to the eye, indicating that the eye is focusing on a near object. The lens, suspensory ligaments, and light rays from the object to the retina are missing from the diagram and need to be drawn to complete it.Complete Fig. 9.2 by drawing the shape of the lens, suspensory ligaments and the light rays from the object to the retina.","To complete Fig. 9.2 for focusing on a near object:
1.  **Lens shape:** The lens should be drawn as significantly thicker and more convex (more rounded) than when focusing on a distant object.
2.  **Suspensory ligaments:** The suspensory ligaments should be drawn as slack or relaxed, as the ciliary muscles would be contracted, moving closer to the lens, thereby reducing tension on the ligaments.
3.  **Light rays:** Light rays originating from the near object should be drawn diverging as they enter the eye. These diverging rays then pass through the thicker, more convex lens. The lens, due to its increased curvature, will strongly refract these diverging rays, causing them to converge sharply onto the retina, forming a clear, focused image."
"Fig. 10.1 shows a few bees with pollen on their legs, illustrating the role of bees in pollination. The question asks about the origin of pollen within a flower.State where pollen is produced in a flower.",Pollen is produced in the anther of a flower.
"The question asks for adaptations of flowers and pollen grains for insect pollination, a common biological process.Describe the ways in which flowers and pollen grains are adapted for insect pollination.","Flowers and pollen grains exhibit several adaptations for insect pollination: 

**Flower adaptations:** 
1. **Large/Obvious Petals:** Flowers often have large, brightly colored, or showy petals to visually attract insects. 
2. **Scent:** Many flowers produce a strong, often sweet, scent to attract insects from a distance. 
3. **Nectar Guides:** Some flowers have patterns or lines on their petals (nectar guides) that are visible to insects and direct them towards the nectaries. 
4. **Nectaries:** Flowers produce nectar, a sugary fluid, as a reward for visiting insects, encouraging repeat visits. 
5. **Position of Anthers and Stigmas:** Anthers (where pollen is produced) and stigmas (which receive pollen) are typically positioned inside the flower in a way that ensures contact with the insect's body as it forages for nectar or pollen. 
6. **Sturdy Filaments:** The filaments supporting the anthers are strong and thick enough to withstand contact with insects without breaking. 
7. **Landing Platforms:** The flower structure often provides a suitable landing platform for insects to perch while feeding. 

**Pollen grain adaptations:** 
1. **Sticky/Spiky Surface:** Pollen grains of insect-pollinated flowers are often relatively large, with a sticky or spiky outer surface. This allows them to readily adhere to the hairy bodies of insects, ensuring effective transfer from one flower to another."
"The question asks for the functions and structural adaptations of two major blood vessels: the aorta and the vena cava, which are key components of the human circulatory system.State the functions of the aorta and the vena cava and describe how each is adapted for its functions.","**Aorta:**
*   **Function:** The aorta's primary function is to transport oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart to all parts of the body, except the lungs.
*   **Adaptations:**
    1.  It has very thick, muscular, and elastic walls. This adaptation allows it to withstand and absorb the high pressure generated by the heart's powerful contractions, preventing it from bursting.
    2.  The elasticity of its walls enables it to stretch when blood is pumped in and then recoil, which helps to maintain a continuous, high-pressure blood flow throughout the arterial system, even when the heart is relaxed.
    3.  It possesses a wide lumen (internal diameter) to minimize resistance to blood flow, allowing a large volume of blood to be transported efficiently and quickly to the body.

**Vena Cava (superior and inferior vena cava):**
*   **Function:** The vena cava's primary function is to transport deoxygenated blood from various parts of the body (superior vena cava from the upper body and head; inferior vena cava from the lower body) back to the right atrium of the heart.
*   **Adaptations:**
    1.  It has relatively thin and less muscular walls compared to the aorta. This is because the blood pressure in veins is much lower, so thick walls are not required.
    2.  It has a wide lumen. This large diameter reduces resistance and facilitates the efficient return of a large volume of blood to the heart at low pressure.
    3.  While not explicitly mentioned in the mark scheme for vena cava specifically, larger veins (including parts of the vena cava) often contain valves. These valves prevent the backflow of blood, ensuring that blood flows in one direction, towards the heart, particularly against gravity."
"Fig. 1.1a shows a plant before watering, during a drought, where its leaves are wilted and drooping. A drought implies conditions of high temperature and low humidity. Wilting is a condition where plant leaves lose turgor pressure and become limp.Describe and explain two factors that would affect the rate of transpiration of the plant in Fig. 1.1a during a drought.","During a drought, two factors affecting transpiration are temperature and humidity. As the temperature during the drought is very high, there will be an increase in the rate of evaporation of water from the surfaces of the leaf, which increases the rate of transpiration. As the humidity is very low, the water vapour concentration gradient between the surrounding air and the intercellular air space (in the leaf) is very high. This causes water vapour to diffuse out of the leaf more rapidly, increasing the rate of transpiration."
"Fig. 1.1a shows a plant before watering, during a drought, where its leaves are wilted and drooping. Wilting is a condition where plant leaves lose turgor pressure and become limp.Suggest how wilting helps the plant to survive during a drought when water is in short supply.","Wilting causes the leaves to droop or fold up, which reduces the surface area exposed to sunlight. This helps the plant to reduce transpiration as the guard cells turn flaccid."

The y-axis represents uptake or loss of oxygen, with '0' as the baseline. Values above '0' indicate net oxygen uptake, and values below '0' indicate net oxygen loss. The graph shows net oxygen loss from midnight until approximately 0600 hours, followed by a period of net oxygen uptake from around 0800 hours to 1700 hours, peaking around noon. From approximately 1700 hours, oxygen uptake decreases, crossing the zero line shortly after 1800 hours, and then shows increasing net oxygen loss until midnight. Specifically, between 1800 hours and 2000 hours, the graph shows oxygen uptake decreasing to zero around 1815-1830 hours, and then a clear period of net oxygen loss, indicating that oxygen is being consumed at a higher rate than it is produced.Explain the processes taking place in the leaf between 1800 hours and 2000 hours.","Between 1800 hours and 2000 hours, the uptake of oxygen decreases and then becomes a net loss. This indicates that the rate of respiration in the plant is increasing as the light intensity decreases to zero at night, meaning photosynthesis is no longer occurring or is occurring at a much lower rate than respiration."

The decrease in pH indicates increased acidity.explain how the oxygen debt results in the changes in pH in his muscles.","During intense exercise, aerobic respiration is not able to meet the energy demands of the athlete. Muscles then respire anaerobically in addition to aerobically to generate more energy, which creates an oxygen debt. Anaerobic respiration releases lactic acid as a by-product.

Frequent coughing can cause emphysema, where the walls of the alveoli are damaged, which reduces the surface area available for gaseous exchange."
"Fig. 3.1 shows a cross-section of the human heart, indicating a heart defect. The heart has a Right Ventricle on the left side of the diagram and a Left Ventricle on the right. A large vessel labelled 'J' enters the coiled structure 'I' at the top-right. A vessel labelled 'H' exits the coiled structure 'I'. A large artery, labelled 'A', originates from the top of the Left Ventricle and arches upwards. Another vessel, labelled 'B', enters the Left Atrium from the top right. A 'Heart defect' is indicated as a hole between the Left Ventricle and Right Ventricle in the septum.Identify the blood vessels labelled A and B in Fig. 3.1.","A: Aorta, B: Pulmonary vein."
"Fig. 3.1 shows a cross-section of the heart, a muscular organ with four chambers (right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle) and associated major blood vessels and valves, designed for pumping blood.Describe how the heart works to generate a heartbeat.","During atrial systole, the higher pressure in the atriums compared to the ventricles causes the atrio-ventricular valves to open, forcing blood into the ventricles. During ventricular systole, the higher pressure in the ventricles compared to the atrium and arteries causes the semi-lunar valves to open, and simultaneously, the atrio-ventricular valves close, creating the 'lub' sound. As blood is pumped to the lungs and the rest of the body, the higher pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery causes the semi-lunar valves to close to prevent backflow of blood, which creates the softer 'dub' sound."
"Fig. 3.1 shows a 'Heart defect' as a hole in the median septum, which is the wall between the left and right ventricles. This defect allows for the mixing of oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart with deoxygenated blood from the right side.Predict how the heart defect will affect the lifestyle of this person.","The hole in the median septum will cause oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to mix with deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart. This results in less oxygen being transported in the blood around the body. Consequently, the person will have reduced oxygen supply to their tissues and will be unable to participate in any strenuous physical activities."
Fig. 3.2 is a graph showing pressure changes in the left side of the heart and aorta over time. The question states that the total length of a cardiac cycle is 0.8 seconds.Calculate how many times the heart described in Fig 3.2 will beat in one minute.,The heart will beat 75 times in one minute. (Calculation: 60 seconds / 0.8 seconds per cardiac cycle = 75 beats per minute).
"Fig. 3.3 shows transverse sections of two types of blood vessels. Vessel X has a thick, muscular, and elastic wall, with a relatively small, round lumen. Vessel Y has a much thinner wall, a larger, often irregular or collapsed lumen, and less muscle and elastic tissue compared to X.Describe the differences in the structures X and Y as shown in Fig. 3.3.","Blood vessel Y has thinner, less muscular, and less elastic walls compared to blood vessel X. This typically means vessel Y (vein) has a larger and more irregular lumen, while vessel X (artery) has a smaller, rounder lumen."
"Fig. 4 shows a model of a kidney nephron function. A mixture of red dye and coarse sand is continuously stirred in a reservoir at the top, which connects via rubber tubing to a structure labelled 'J' (incoming vessel) then to a coiled capillary bed labelled 'I' (filtration unit), from which a vessel labelled 'H' (outgoing vessel) emerges. The liquid then flows through a convoluted tubule system, passing a 'small pore', and eventually exits as 'Mixture out' and 'Red dye' into a beaker. A screw clip is shown on the incoming vessel 'J'.Identify the labelled structures H, I and J.","H: Efferent arteriole, I: Glomerulus, J: Afferent arteriole."
"Fig. 4 shows a model of a kidney nephron function, which involves filtration of a mixture containing red dye and coarse sand. The coarse sand represents components of blood that are typically not filtered out by the glomerulus.Name one cell type or organic compound in the mammalian body that is represented by the coarse sand in the mixture.",One cell type or organic compound represented by the coarse sand in the mixture is a red blood cell or plasma proteins.
"Fig. 4 shows a model of a kidney nephron function, where part I is identified as the glomerulus, a coiled capillary bed. The model illustrates the separation of substances from the 'blood' (mixture) into the tubule system.State the key process that part I is involved in during excretion.",The key process that part I (glomerulus) is involved in during excretion is ultrafiltration.
"The question concerns the reabsorption of water in the kidneys, which is controlled by a hormone produced by an endocrine gland.The reabsorption of water in the kidneys is controlled by a hormone produced by an endocrine gland. Name this hormone and state its role in the kidneys during excretion.","The hormone is Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). Its role in the kidneys during excretion is to control the permeability of the proximal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct to water, thereby regulating water reabsorption."
"The question asks for a comparison between the nervous system and the hormonal system, which are two major control systems in the body.Describe two differences between the nervous system and the hormonal system.","Firstly, the nervous system transmits information via nerve impulses (electrical signals) through neurons, resulting in rapid and short-lived responses, whereas the hormonal system transmits information via chemical hormones through the bloodstream, leading to slower but often prolonged responses. Secondly, nervous responses tend to be localized and affect specific target organs, while hormonal responses can be widespread and affect multiple target organs or tissues throughout the body."
"Fig. 5.1 shows a section of DNA, represented as a double helix structure. Each strand consists of a sugar-phosphate backbone, with nitrogenous bases (rectangular blocks) paired in the center. The key indicates 'C = Cytosine'. One base is labeled 'C' and its paired base is labeled 'X'. A nucleotide is the basic structural unit of DNA, composed of a phosphate group (circle), a deoxyribose sugar (pentagon), and a nitrogenous base (rectangle). For example, the top-left phosphate group, its attached sugar, and the base 'C' form one nucleotide.On Fig. 5.1, circle one nucleotide.","On Fig. 5.1, one nucleotide can be identified as a unit consisting of a phosphate group (represented by a circle), a deoxyribose sugar (represented by a pentagonal shape), and a nitrogenous base (represented by a rectangular block, such as 'C'). For example, one could circle the topmost phosphate, sugar, and the attached 'C' base on the left strand."
"Fig. 5.1 shows DNA as a double helix structure, which is the fundamental genetic material.Outline the relationship between DNA, genes and chromosomes.","A gene is a specific sequence of nucleotides within a DNA molecule that codes for a particular polypeptide or protein. DNA molecules are organized and packaged into structures called chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Therefore, a chromosome is essentially a long molecule of DNA that contains many genes."
"The table presents blood group data categorized into distinct types: A, AB, B, and O. These are separate, non-overlapping categories.Identify and explain the type of variation that is shown by the blood group.","The blood group shows discontinuous variation. This is because there are distinct, clear-cut categories (A, AB, B, O) with no intermediate forms. The genes determining blood group do not show an additive effect, leading to discrete phenotypes rather than a continuous range of traits."
"Fig. 5.1 shows a family tree where Melody's parents are Nat (Blood group B) and Bruce (Blood group B). Melody's blood group is unknown. Within the wider family (Tony and Pepper's children), Blood group O (genotype ii) is present (James). This indicates that the 'i' allele is common in the family line. If both Nat and Bruce are heterozygous (I^B i), they can produce children with genotype ii.Deduce using Fig. 5.1 the possible blood group(s) that Melody could have.","Melody's parents, Nat and Bruce, both have Blood group B. Given the presence of Blood Group O (ii) in the extended family (James, son of Tony and Pepper), it is highly probable that Nat and Bruce are both heterozygous, with genotypes I^B i. If both parents are I^B i, their offspring could have genotypes I^B I^B, I^B i, or i i. Therefore, Melody could have Blood Group B or Blood Group O."
"Fig. 7 shows a food web comprising: Water plant (producer), Tadpole (eats water plant), Water beetle (eats water plant), Snail (eats water plant), Small fish (eats tadpole, water beetle, snail), Frog (eats water beetle), Kingfisher (eats small fish, frog). A food chain with at least four trophic levels could be: Water plant -> Tadpole -> Small fish -> Kingfisher, or Water plant -> Water beetle -> Frog -> Kingfisher.Draw a pyramid of biomass for a food chain that consists of at least four trophic levels.","A pyramid of biomass should be drawn with a large base representing the producers (Water plant). The next level above should be narrower, representing the primary consumers (e.g., Tadpole or Water beetle). The level above that, still narrower, would represent the secondary consumers (e.g., Small fish or Frog). Finally, the apex of the pyramid, the narrowest level, would represent the tertiary consumer (Kingfisher). Each level must be clearly labeled with the organism or trophic level it represents, demonstrating a decrease in biomass at successive trophic levels."
"The question asks for a definition of a carbon sink and the importance of oceans in this role, relating to the cycling of carbon in ecosystems.The oceans and forests help in the cycling of carbon in our ecosystem. Define the term carbon sink and describe the importance of the oceans as a carbon sink.","A carbon sink is an area or reservoir that absorbs and stores carbon compounds from the atmosphere for an indefinite period of time, accumulating more carbon than it releases. Oceans are important carbon sinks because carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves into seawater and is subsequently absorbed by marine organisms like phytoplankton for photosynthesis. Additionally, carbon compounds from dead marine organisms can be buried under the seabed over geological time, forming fossil fuels, thereby locking carbon away for very long periods."
"Fig. 7 shows kingfishers as top predators in the food web, consuming small fish and frogs. Small fish, frogs, tadpoles, water beetles, and snails are all part of the aquatic/semi-aquatic food chain, ultimately relying on water plants. The question states that kingfishers frequently prey along rivers near farming communities where farmers excessively use DDT, and high levels of DDT have been found in kingfishers.Explain how the excessive use of DDT by the farmers affects the survival of the kingfishers.","Excessive use of DDT by farmers can result in the pesticide washing into nearby rivers. DDT is a non-biodegradable pesticide, meaning it cannot be broken down and is not easily excreted by organisms. It accumulates in the tissues of organisms at the bottom of the food chain, such as water plants and microscopic algae. As organisms consume others in the food web, the concentration of DDT increases at each successive trophic level through a process called bio-accumulation and bio-amplification. Since kingfishers are top predators (eating small fish and frogs), they accumulate the highest concentrations of DDT, which can reach lethal levels and severely affect their health, reproduction, and ultimately, their survival."
The question asks to distinguish between two fundamental modes of reproduction in flowering plants.Distinguish between asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction in flowering plants.,"Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion of gametes, whereas sexual reproduction does. In asexual reproduction, only one parent is involved, while sexual reproduction typically involves two parents. Offspring produced by asexual reproduction are genetically identical to the parent, forming clones, whereas offspring from sexual reproduction exhibit genetic variation. Asexual reproduction is generally a quicker method and produces a larger number of offspring compared to sexual reproduction."
"Fig. 8.1 shows a flower. This flower has prominent, large petals. The stigma appears relatively small and compact, not extending far from the center of the flower.Describe and explain two adaptations observed in Fig. 8.1 that facilitate pollination of this flower.","One adaptation observed in Fig. 8.1 is the presence of large petals, which serve to visually attract insects to the flower, encouraging them to land for nectar or pollen collection and thereby facilitating insect pollination. A second adaptation is the small, compact stigma that does not protrude significantly. This positioning suggests it is well-suited for insect pollination, where visiting insects are likely to brush against it and deposit pollen while foraging, ensuring efficient pollen reception."
"Fig. 8.1 shows a flower, which is the reproductive organ of a flowering plant, containing the stigma, style, ovule, etc. The question concerns the processes following successful pollination of such a flower.Describe the processes that takes place in a flower from Fig. 8 after it is successfully pollinated.","After successful pollination, the mature stigma secretes a sugary fluid that stimulates the pollen grain to germinate. A pollen tube then grows out from the pollen grain, extending down the style. The pollen tube secretes enzymes to digest the tissues of the stigma and style as it grows. The pollen tube eventually reaches the ovule by entering through the micropyle, where it releases the male gametes. These male gametes then fuse with the female gametes in the ovule during fertilisation."
"The question asks about the roles and levels of oestrogen and progesterone, two key hormones in the menstrual cycle.Describe the levels of hormone oestrogen and progesterone and its effect in the menstrual cycle.","During the menstrual flow stage (approximately days 1-5), both oestrogen and progesterone levels are very low, leading to the shedding of the uterine lining (menstruation). In the follicle stage (approximately days 6-13), follicle cells produce increasing amounts of oestrogen, which stimulates the repair and growth of the uterine lining. Following ovulation, during the corpus luteum stage (approximately days 16-28), the corpus luteum secretes both progesterone and some oestrogen. Progesterone maintains and further thickens the uterine lining, building up more blood capillaries, preparing it for implantation. If fertilisation does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, causing a sharp decrease in both oestrogen and progesterone levels, which triggers the breakdown of the uterine lining and the start of menstruation again. If fertilisation occurs, the corpus luteum persists, continuing to produce these hormones until the placenta takes over, thereby maintaining the uterine lining and preventing menstruation."
"Fig. 8.2 shows a section of a mother's uterus containing a foetus. Structure A is the placenta, a disc-shaped organ embedded in the uterine wall. Structure B is the amniotic fluid, a clear liquid surrounding the foetus. Structure C is the umbilical cord, a tube connecting the foetus to the placenta (A), containing blood vessels.With reference to structures A, B and C, describe how they help to support the growth and development of the foetus during pregnancy.","Structure A, the placenta, supports the foetus by separating maternal blood from foetal blood, protecting the foetus from the mother's high blood pressure and preventing direct mixing of incompatible blood types. It also allows for the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the foetus, and waste products and carbon dioxide from the foetus to the mother. Furthermore, the placenta produces progesterone to maintain the uterine lining. Structure B, the amniotic fluid, provides a protective cushion for the foetus, acting as a shock absorber against physical injury and maintaining a stable temperature. Structure C, the umbilical cord, connects the foetus to the placenta. Its umbilical arteries transport deoxygenated blood and metabolic waste products from the foetus to the placenta, while the umbilical veins transport oxygenated blood and nutrients from the placenta to the foetus."
"The following is a list of laboratory steps for chemical tests: (I) Add copper(II) sulfate drop by drop, (II) Shake well to mix, (III) Place in a boiling water-bath, (IV) Add Benedict's solution, (V) Add sodium hydroxide solution. The Biuret test is used to detect the presence of protein. This test requires an alkaline environment, typically achieved by adding sodium hydroxide, followed by the addition of copper(II) sulfate. The copper(II) ions then react with peptide bonds in the protein, producing a characteristic purple/violet color. Shaking ensures proper mixing of the reagents with the sample. Steps (III) and (IV) are part of the Benedict's test, which is used to detect reducing sugars and requires heating, and are not part of the Biuret test for proteins.Arrange the steps in the order which they need to be carried out to show the presence of a protein.

A IV, I, III
B IV, V, II
C V, I, II
D V, II, I","Option D is correct. The Biuret test for protein involves establishing an alkaline environment and then introducing copper(II) ions. The correct sequence of steps for this test is to first add sodium hydroxide solution (V) to make the mixture alkaline. Then, shake well to mix (II) the sodium hydroxide with the sample. Finally, add copper(II) sulfate solution drop by drop (I). If protein is present, a purple/violet color will develop. Steps (III) and (IV) are associated with the Benedict's test for reducing sugars and are irrelevant for protein detection."
"The diagram shows a section of the wall of the duodenum. V and W both point to structures within the villi, which are finger-like projections of the inner lining (mucosa) of the duodenum that increase surface area for absorption. V specifically points to the epithelial cells or the immediate luminal contents near the absorption surface of the villus. W points to a deeper region within the villus, representing absorbed nutrients within the villus cells or the underlying lacteal/capillaries before systemic circulation. X represents the submucosa layer, located beneath the villi, which contains glands (e.g., Brunner's glands) and blood vessels. Y represents the muscularis externa, consisting of layers of smooth muscle responsible for peristalsis. Z represents the serosa, the outermost layer of connective tissue covering the duodenum.An extract was taken from point X. Which of the following is correct?

A Its contents will be acidic in nature.
B Its contents will contain enzymes active in both neutral and alkaline pH.
C Its contents will be able to digest polypeptides.
D Its contents will contain a substance that can physically digest fats.","Option C is correct. Point X represents the submucosa of the duodenum, which contains Brunner's glands. These glands secrete an alkaline fluid containing peptidases (enzymes that digest polypeptides). Therefore, an extract from point X would be able to digest polypeptides. Option A is incorrect because the duodenum's environment is alkaline, not acidic, to neutralize the acidic chyme from the stomach. Option B is too general; while some enzymes have broad ranges, the key enzymes in the duodenum (from the pancreas and intestinal wall) function optimally in alkaline conditions. Option D is incorrect because the physical digestion (emulsification) of fats is carried out by bile, which is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, not secreted from point X within the duodenal wall."
"A group of students investigated the effect of soaking small onion bulbs in different concentrations of sodium chloride solution. They peeled off the outer papery leaves of the onion bulbs and divided the onions into 6 batches, each with 10 onions. The onions were surface dried with paper towels and weighed. The mean mass of the onions in each batch was calculated. The onions were then left in sodium chloride solutions for three hours. After three hours, the students surface dried the onions and weighed them again. Their results are given in Table 1.1. Table 1.1 shows: 'concentration of sodium chloride solution / g dm⁻³' with values 0, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200. 'mean mass of onions / g before soaking' with values 147, 153, 176, 154, 149, 183. 'mean mass of onions / g after soaking for 3 hours' with values 173, 165, 172, 149, 142, 175. The final column 'percentage change in mass / %' contains values +17.7, +7.8, -2.3, -3.2, -4.7, and the last row is empty.Explain why the students calculated the percentage change in mass of the onions.","The initial masses of the onions in different batches were not all the same. Calculating the percentage change in mass allows for a valid and fair comparison between batches, helping to accurately determine the water potential of the onion cells."
"A group of students investigated the effect of soaking small onion bulbs in different concentrations of sodium chloride solution. Onions were weighed before and after soaking in solutions for three hours, and the percentage change in mass was recorded. Water moves by osmosis through partially permeable membranes. Onion cell sap has a certain water potential, and sodium chloride solutions have varying water potentials.Using the term water potential, explain why the onions change in mass when soaked in dilute solutions of sodium chloride.","When onions are soaked in dilute solutions of sodium chloride, water moves by osmosis through the partially permeable membranes of the onion cells. If the onion cell sap has a lower water potential than the dilute sodium chloride solution (meaning the solution has a higher water potential than the cell sap), water will enter the onion cells. This influx of water causes the cells to swell and consequently leads to a gain in the overall mass of the onions."
"Fig. 2.1 shows parts of the alimentary canal in the upper part of the human body. E is a tube positioned vertically, connecting a region F at the top (likely the pharynx/mouth) to a J-shaped organ G (the stomach) below. E is located above the stomach.Name the part labelled E.",Part E is the oesophagus.
"Fig. 2.1 shows parts of the alimentary canal in the upper part of the human body. F represents the pharynx/mouth region, and G is the stomach. E, the oesophagus, connects F to G. Food needs to be transported from the pharynx to the stomach.Name the process that carries food from F to G.",The process that carries food from F (pharynx/mouth) to G (stomach) through the oesophagus is peristalsis.
"Fig. 2.1 shows parts of the alimentary canal in the upper part of the human body, including G, which is the stomach. H is labeled as the wall of the stomach. The stomach secretes gastric juice containing hydrochloric acid and inactive pepsinogen, which is converted to active pepsin.Suggest why the walls of part H are normally coated with mucus.","The walls of part H, the stomach, secrete mucus for several reasons. Firstly, the gastric juice in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, which is highly corrosive, and pepsin, a protease enzyme that can digest proteins. Mucus provides a protective barrier, preventing the acid and pepsin from damaging or corroding the stomach lining itself, which is made of protein. Secondly, mucus also serves as a lubricant, aiding in the smooth movement of food during peristalsis within the stomach."
"Heartburn occurs when acidic, partly digested food returns from the stomach into the oesophagus. The oesophagus typically has less protective mucus lining compared to the stomach, making its walls vulnerable to damage from the acid.Suggest and explain why medications for this condition are often alkaline in nature.","Medications for heartburn are often alkaline in nature because they work by neutralizing the acidic stomach contents that have refluxed into the oesophagus. This neutralization helps to relieve the burning sensation and prevent damage to the oesophageal walls, which are irritated by the acid."
"Fig. 3.1 illustrates the sequence of changes within the ovary during the menstrual cycle. The diagram shows various developing follicles and a distinct, large, irregularly shaped structure labeled R. This structure R is shown to form after the release of an egg from a mature follicle. Another structure, S, is depicted as a developing follicle containing an oocyte (egg cell). Multiple such structures, representing different stages of growth, are visible within the ovary.Name structures R and S.","R is the corpus luteum, which develops from the follicle after ovulation. S is a Graafian follicle, a mature fluid-filled follicle in the ovary that contains an ovum ready for ovulation."
"Fig. 3.1 illustrates the sequence of changes within the ovary during the menstrual cycle. The diagram shows an egg being released from a mature follicle, a process indicated at position T.State the name of the process that is occurring at T.","The process occurring at T, where an egg is released from a mature follicle, is ovulation."
The ovary secretes hormones that control the growth and maintenance of the lining of the uterus throughout the menstrual cycle.Name the hormone that stimulates: the growth of the lining of the uterus during the first half of the menstrual cycle.,The hormone that stimulates the growth of the lining of the uterus during the first half of the menstrual cycle is oestrogen.
The ovary secretes hormones that control the growth and maintenance of the lining of the uterus throughout the menstrual cycle.Name the hormone that stimulates: the maintenance of the lining of the uterus during the second half of the menstrual cycle.,The hormone that stimulates the maintenance of the lining of the uterus during the second half of the menstrual cycle is progesterone.
"Fig. 4.1 shows the mean heart rates of two groups of people, J and K, over a five-year period. Group J did not take any form of medication, while group K was treated with a beta-blocker from the start and throughout the period. Group J's heart rate remained relatively stable between 80-85 beats per minute.State the term used to describe group J.",Group J is the control group.
"Fig. 4.1 displays the mean heart rates of two groups over 60 months. Group J, which received no medication, showed a mean heart rate fluctuating between approximately 80 and 85 beats per minute. Group K, treated with a beta-blocker, initially had a mean heart rate around 85 beats per minute at 0 months. This rate then decreased rapidly to approximately 62 beats per minute by 4 months, and subsequently remained relatively constant, fluctuating between 59 and 62 beats per minute for the remainder of the 60-month period.Using information from Fig. 4.1, describe the effect on the heart of taking beta-blockers.","Based on Fig. 4.1, taking beta-blockers, as observed in group K, causes a significant decrease in mean heart rate. Initially, the heart rate was around 85 beats per minute, similar to group J. However, within the first four months, it rapidly dropped to approximately 62 beats per minute. After this initial decrease, the heart rate remained relatively constant and lower, between 59 and 62 beats per minute, for the rest of the 60-month period, demonstrating that beta-blockers effectively lower and stabilize the heart rate."
"Fig. 4.1 shows the mean heart rates of two groups of people, J and K, over a five-year period (60 months). Group J did not take any medication, maintaining a mean heart rate between 80 and 85 beats per minute. Group K was treated with a beta-blocker, and their heart rate decreased and stabilized between 59 and 62 beats per minute. Three years is equivalent to 36 months.On Fig. 4.1, draw a curve to show the expected effect on the mean heart rate of Group J if, after three years, half of them started to take beta-blockers.","At 36 months, the mean heart rate for Group J is approximately 82 bpm. If half of Group J starts taking beta-blockers, and assuming their heart rate drops to a level similar to Group K (around 60 bpm) while the other half remains at 82 bpm, the new mean heart rate for Group J would be approximately (0.5 * 82 bpm) + (0.5 * 60 bpm) = 41 bpm + 30 bpm = 71 bpm. Therefore, a curve should be drawn starting at 36 months from the current Group J line (around 82 bpm), sharply decreasing with a similar gradient to the initial drop seen in Group K, to reach approximately 71 bpm, and then continuing horizontally (or parallel to Group J and K) at this new lower mean heart rate."
"A particular type of flower displays co-dominance and multiple alleles for flower colour. The alleles for purple (P) and red (R) are co-dominant, meaning both traits are expressed when together. Both the red (R) and purple (P) alleles are completely dominant to the white (W) allele. Plant 1 produces purple flowers with patches of red, indicating a genotype of PR. Plant 2 produces pure purple flowers, meaning its genotype could be PP or PW.Explain how you use the results of a test cross with Plant 2 to determine if Plant 2 is heterozygous or homozygous for flower colour.","To determine if Plant 2 (pure purple flowers, genotype PP or PW) is heterozygous or homozygous, a test cross should be performed by crossing Plant 2 with a plant producing white flowers, which has a homozygous recessive genotype (WW). If all the offspring from this test cross have purple flowers (genotype PW), then Plant 2 must be homozygous (PP). However, if approximately 50% of the offspring have purple flowers (PW) and 50% have white flowers (WW), then Plant 2 must be heterozygous (PW)."
"Sloths are mammals living in South American rainforests. They are extremely slow-moving. Their fur is often green due to single-celled, plant-like organisms (algae) growing on it. Sloths are preyed upon by jungle cats and harpy eagles. Their slow movement makes them unable to escape quickly from predators.Suggest and explain an advantage to the sloths of the algae that live in their fur.","The algae living in the sloth's fur provide excellent camouflage. The green coloration of the algae blends the sloth with its leafy rainforest environment, making it less easily seen by predators like jungle cats and harpy eagles. This is particularly advantageous for sloths, as their extremely slow movement means they cannot escape quickly once detected."
"Fig. 7.1 shows flowers from the same plant species at two different developmental stages, D and E. Both flowers are insect-pollinated. In flower D, the anthers (male reproductive parts) are prominent and located above the stigma (female receptive part), which appears closed or immature. This suggests pollen is being released. In flower E, the anthers appear withered or lower, while the stigma is prominent, open, and receptive, located above the anthers. This suggests the stigma is ready to receive pollen but no longer releasing it.Explain why the insect must visit flower D before visiting flower E.","The insect must visit flower D before flower E due to the different stages of sexual maturity in the flowers, a mechanism known as dichogamy, specifically protandry (male parts mature first). In flower D, the anthers are mature and releasing pollen, while the stigma is immature and not receptive. When an insect visits flower D, it collects pollen. In contrast, in flower E, the anthers are withered and no longer producing pollen, but the stigma is mature and receptive. Therefore, an insect carrying pollen from a flower at stage D can effectively cross-pollinate a flower at stage E, ensuring genetic diversity and efficient transfer of pollen."
Flowers of a certain species are adapted to be pollinated by insects such as bees. These flowers are actual size 25 mm and have a nectary labeled at their base.Suggest how flowers of this species are adapted to be pollinated by an insect such as a bee.,"Flowers of this species are adapted for insect pollination by bees in several ways. Firstly, they likely possess large, colourful petals that act as a visual attractant and provide a landing platform for bees. Secondly, the petals are often scented to release appealing fragrances that draw bees towards the flower. Thirdly, the presence of nectaries, as indicated in the diagram, provides a sweet, energy-rich reward (nectar) for the bees, encouraging their visit. Nectar guides (patterns on petals) may also be present to direct bees towards the nectary. Lastly, the pollen grains are typically sticky or hooked, allowing them to readily attach to the bee's hairy body, and the bee makes contact with the anther and stigma while collecting nectar, facilitating pollen transfer."
An investigation on the effect of wind speed on leaf transpiration kept a constant light intensity. Leaves lose water through stomata. Light intensity influences stomatal opening.Predict and explain the effect of increasing light intensity on water loss from leaf.,"Increasing light intensity is predicted to increase the rate of water loss from the leaf. This is because higher light intensity promotes photosynthesis, which in turn signals the guard cells to increase the size of the stomatal pores. A larger stomatal opening leads to a greater surface area for gaseous exchange and, consequently, an increased rate of diffusion of water vapour out of the stomata into the surrounding atmosphere, resulting in more water loss."
"An experiment measuring the effect of wind speed on leaf transpiration recorded the absolute 'change in mass / g' of leaves. The initial masses of the leaves used in the experiment were not all the same (e.g., 5.7 g, 5.3 g, 5.9 g, 5.1 g, 5.3 g). A student criticized the results, stating that comparing the absolute change in mass does not allow for a fair comparison between leaves.Suggest a more appropriate calculation and explain why it gives a fairer comparison.","A more appropriate calculation would be to determine the percentage change in mass instead of the absolute change in mass. This is because the initial masses of the leaves were not identical. Calculating the percentage change in mass normalizes the data relative to each leaf's starting mass, thus allowing for a valid and fair comparison of water loss rates among leaves of different initial sizes."
"Researchers investigated the rate of photosynthesis in aspen leaves (Populus grandidentata) by measuring carbon dioxide uptake over a temperature range of 10-40 °C, at two different CO2 concentrations. Curve H represents results at 325 ppm CO2 (atmospheric concentration), while curve J represents results at 1935 ppm CO2 (very high concentration). The graph (Fig. 9.1) shows 'uptake of carbon dioxide / mg m⁻² min⁻¹' on the y-axis and 'temperature / °C' on the x-axis. For curve H, CO2 uptake peaks at approximately 11 mg m⁻² min⁻¹ at 25°C, and then decreases. For curve J, CO2 uptake peaks at approximately 27 mg m⁻² min⁻¹ at 35°C, and then decreases. At 10°C, both H and J show similar CO2 uptake rates of about 5 mg m⁻² min⁻¹. Curve J's uptake rates are generally higher than curve H's, except at 10°C.Describe how the results for the aspen leaves in batch J differ from the results for the aspen leaves in batch H. Use data from Fig. 9.1 in your answer.","The results for aspen leaves in batch J (1935 ppm CO2) differ significantly from batch H (325 ppm CO2). Firstly, the carbon dioxide uptake rate for batch J is generally higher than for batch H across most temperatures, except at 10°C where both show an uptake of approximately 5 mg m⁻² min⁻¹. For example, at 25°C, batch H peaks at around 11 mg m⁻² min⁻¹, while batch J is already higher, around 20 mg m⁻² min⁻¹. Secondly, the optimum temperature for CO2 uptake is higher for batch J; its peak uptake of approximately 27 mg m⁻² min⁻¹ occurs at 35°C, whereas batch H's peak uptake of around 11 mg m⁻² min⁻¹ occurs at 25°C. Furthermore, batch J maintains a relatively high rate of CO2 uptake between 35-40°C (e.g., ~18 mg m⁻² min⁻¹ at 40°C), while batch H's uptake drops sharply in this range (to near 0 mg m⁻² min⁻¹ at 40°C)."
"Fig. 9.1 shows that at higher carbon dioxide concentrations (Batch J, 1935 ppm), the rate of carbon dioxide uptake during photosynthesis is generally higher and peaks at a higher temperature (35°C, 27 mg m⁻² min⁻¹) compared to atmospheric concentrations (Batch H, 325 ppm), which peak at a lower temperature (25°C, 11 mg m⁻² min⁻¹). Plant growth is a result of photosynthesis producing glucose, which is then used for energy, structural components, and storage. The combustion of fossil fuels releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is also a greenhouse gas.Use the results in Fig. 9.1 to suggest and explain the likely effect on plant growth of an increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels.","An increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration due to fossil fuel combustion is likely to result in increased plant growth, at least in the short term. The results in Fig. 9.1 demonstrate that higher CO2 concentrations (like batch J's 1935 ppm) lead to significantly higher rates of carbon dioxide uptake during photosynthesis compared to atmospheric levels (batch H's 325 ppm). A higher rate of photosynthesis means more glucose is produced. This glucose can then be used for respiration to provide energy for growth, converted into cellulose for cell walls, or stored as starch, all contributing to greater biomass and overall plant growth. However, it's also important to consider the long-term effects: increased CO2 acts as a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. While increased temperatures might initially increase enzyme activity in photosynthesis, excessively high temperatures can cause enzymes to denature, potentially slowing down photosynthesis and plant growth in the long run. Furthermore, other factors such as nutrient availability and water will become limiting factors at very high CO2 concentrations."
"A person is initially sitting in the shade reading a book, which implies their eyes are adapted for close-up vision in dim light. They then look up at the bright sky to see a distant aeroplane, requiring their eyes to adapt for distant vision in bright light. The lens of the eye changes shape to focus light from objects at different distances.Explain the changes in the lens of the eye.","When the person switches from reading a book (near object) to looking at a distant aeroplane, the eye needs to accommodate for distant vision. To achieve this, the ciliary muscles around the lens relax. This relaxation causes the suspensory ligaments, which connect the ciliary body to the lens, to tighten. The tension in the suspensory ligaments pulls on the lens, causing it to become thinner and less convex. This change increases the focal length of the lens, allowing light rays from the distant aeroplane to be focused sharply on the retina."
"A person is initially sitting in the shade reading a book, meaning their eyes are exposed to dim light. They then look up at the bright sky to see an aeroplane, meaning their eyes are exposed to bright light. The pupil, an opening in the iris, controls the amount of light entering the eye.Explain the changes in the pupil of the eye.","When the person looks from the shade (dim light) to the bright sky (bright light), the retina detects the increased light intensity. An impulse is then sent to the brain, which transmits signals to the iris. This causes the circular muscles within the iris to contract, while the radial muscles relax. The contraction of the circular muscles makes the pupil smaller, reducing the amount of bright light entering the eye, thereby protecting the retina from overstimulation."
"The trachea is a part of the respiratory system, lined with epithelial cells that have cilia and secrete mucus.Describe the role of the cilia in the trachea.","The cilia in the trachea play a crucial role in protecting the respiratory system. Gland cells in the tracheal lining secrete mucus, which traps inhaled dust particles, microorganisms (like bacteria), and other foreign substances. The cilia are tiny, hair-like projections on the epithelial cells that continuously beat in an upward, coordinated motion. This action sweeps the dust-trapped mucus upwards and away from the lungs, towards the pharynx, where it can be swallowed or expelled. This mechanism effectively prevents these harmful substances from reaching and infecting the delicate lung tissue."
"Fig. 10.1 shows components of the human gas exchange surface and an associated blood vessel. The diagram depicts a large, thin-walled, roughly spherical structure representing an alveolus (air sac), surrounded by a much narrower, thin-walled vessel representing a blood capillary. Inside the capillary, biconcave disc-shaped red blood cells are visible. The wall of the alveolus and the wall of the capillary are both shown as being extremely thin, typically one cell thick. The inner surface of the alveolar wall is implied to have a layer of moisture.State the characteristics, and describe the roles, of each of the components shown in Fig. 10.1. You should make reference to named structures in your answer.","Fig. 10.1 illustrates the gas exchange surface in the lungs, primarily involving the alveolus, blood capillary, and red blood cells. These components possess specific characteristics and roles to facilitate efficient diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

1.  **Alveolus (Air Sac):** It has a large surface area due to its numerous, spherical shape, which maximizes the area available for gas exchange. Its wall is extremely thin, typically one-cell thick, minimizing the diffusion distance for gases. The alveolar wall is also lined with a thin layer of moisture, which is essential for dissolving oxygen and carbon dioxide, allowing them to diffuse across the membrane.

2.  **Blood Capillary:** The capillary surrounding the alveolus also has a very thin wall, only one-cell thick, further reducing the diffusion distance between the air in the alveolus and the blood. Capillaries are extremely narrow, often only wide enough for red blood cells to pass in single file, which slows down blood flow and increases the exposure of red blood cells to the alveolar air.

3.  **Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes):** These cells are crucial for gas transport. They are biconcave disc-shaped, which increases their surface area to volume ratio, enhancing the efficiency of gas exchange into and out of the cell. Importantly, mature red blood cells lack a nucleus, allowing more space for haemoglobin, the protein responsible for binding and transporting oxygen. When oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood, it binds to haemoglobin in the red blood cells, forming oxyhaemoglobin, which is then transported to oxygen-poor tissues. Conversely, carbon dioxide from tissues is transported in the plasma (mainly as hydrogen carbonate ions) and also bound to haemoglobin. Upon reaching the lungs, carbon dioxide diffuses from the red blood cells and plasma into the alveoli to be expelled during exhalation."
"The diagram displays two kidney-bean-shaped guard cells, which regulate the opening and closing of a central pore. Label A points to several small, oval structures within the cytoplasm of the guard cells. Label B points to the cytoplasm, the jelly-like substance filling the cells and surrounding the organelles. Label C points to the central pore or opening located between the two guard cells. Label D points to the thick outer layer of the guard cell, representing the cell wall.Which label is not correct?
A chloroplast
B cytoplasm
C stoma
D cell wall","Label A (chloroplast) is indicated as not correct. While guard cells do contain chloroplasts and perform photosynthesis, it is possible that the specific depiction of these structures as 'chloroplasts' in the diagram, or a nuanced aspect of guard cell chloroplasts (e.g., their lack of starch accumulation in some species), is considered biologically inaccurate for this context."
"The table provides nutritional data for four food items: bananas, fish, lentils, and milk. The data includes the iron content (mg per 100g), calcium content (mg per 100g), vitamin C content (mg per 100g), and vitamin D content (mg per 100g). For bananas, iron is 0.4, calcium 7, vitamin C 10, vitamin D 0. For fish, iron is 0.4, calcium 28, vitamin C 0, vitamin D 6.38. For lentils, iron is 7.6, calcium 39, vitamin C 0, vitamin D 0. For milk, iron is 0.1, calcium 120, vitamin C 0.5, vitamin D 0.002.Which food would be best for a person suffering from anaemia?
A bananas
B fish
C lentils
D milk","Anaemia is often caused by a deficiency in iron. To determine which food is best for a person suffering from anaemia, we compare the iron content per 100g for each food: bananas have 0.4 mg, fish has 0.4 mg, lentils have 7.6 mg, and milk has 0.1 mg. Lentils contain the highest amount of iron (7.6 mg per 100g) among the options, making them the best choice for addressing anaemia."
"The diagram displays a portion of the mammalian digestive system, including the liver, duodenum, and pancreas. Label A points to the bile duct, which carries bile from the liver and gallbladder towards the duodenum. Label B points to the pancreatic duct, which carries pancreatic juice from the pancreas to the duodenum. The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine, receiving acidic chyme from the stomach and digestive fluids from the liver and pancreas.What is a likely change in the duodenum due to the blockages at A and B?
A decrease in pH of the duodenum
B decrease in the release of glucagon
C increase in the physical digestion of fats
D increase in release of pancreatic proteases","Blockage at A prevents bile from entering the duodenum, and blockage at B prevents pancreatic juice from entering the duodenum. Both bile (from the liver/gallbladder) and pancreatic juice (from the pancreas) contain alkaline components (like bicarbonate ions in pancreatic juice) that are essential for neutralizing the highly acidic chyme entering the duodenum from the stomach. Without these neutralizing fluids, the pH of the duodenum would decrease, becoming more acidic. Therefore, a decrease in the pH of the duodenum is the most likely change."
"Two tables provide blood sample analysis data for Grace (a healthy girl) and Alexis (a patient with an illness). Each table lists carbon dioxide, oxygen, and urea concentrations (in arbitrary units) in blood samples taken from three veins, X, Y, and Z. For Grace: Vein X shows Urea=0.3, CO2=45, O2=34. Vein Y shows Urea=6.8, CO2=48, O2=37. Vein Z shows Urea=5.1, CO2=33, O2=98. For Alexis: Vein X shows Urea=2.9, CO2=43, O2=33. Vein Y shows Urea=6.6, CO2=47, O2=35. Vein Z shows Urea=5.3, CO2=33, O2=97. Typically, the renal vein has very low urea, as the kidneys remove it. Veins returning blood from general circulation would have higher urea, and pulmonary veins have high oxygen and low carbon dioxide.What could Alexis be suffering from?
A atherosclerosis
B diabetes mellitus
C emphysema
D kidney failure","Comparing the data for Grace (healthy) and Alexis (ill), the most significant difference is in the urea concentration of Vein X. In Grace, Vein X has a very low urea concentration (0.3 arbitrary units), which is characteristic of the renal vein after the kidneys have filtered out most of the urea. In Alexis, the urea concentration in Vein X is significantly higher (2.9 arbitrary units). This indicates that Alexis's kidneys are not effectively removing urea from the blood. The CO2 and O2 levels are broadly similar between Grace and Alexis in all veins, suggesting respiratory function is not the primary issue. Therefore, the elevated urea level in what appears to be the renal vein points to kidney failure."
"Platelets are small, disc-shaped blood cells that play a crucial role in hemostasis, the process of stopping bleeding, which is the initial phase of wound healing. When a blood vessel is injured, platelets aggregate at the site of injury and release various chemical factors that initiate the coagulation (clotting) cascade. Key steps in this cascade involve the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, and then fibrinogen to fibrin.What is the function of platelets in wound healing?
A to break down insoluble threads
B to convert insoluble trypsinogen to soluble trypsin
C to release thrombokinase
D to synthesise soluble threads","In wound healing, platelets are essential for blood clot formation. When a blood vessel is damaged, platelets adhere to the injured site and release various factors, including thrombokinase (also known as Factor Xa or thromboplastin). Thrombokinase is an enzyme that initiates the coagulation cascade by converting prothrombin into thrombin, which then leads to the formation of insoluble fibrin threads. Therefore, the function of platelets includes releasing thrombokinase."
"The scenario describes artificial coloring being introduced to blue flowers, and a section of the root is observed under a microscope to confirm this. Artificial colors are typically absorbed along with water via the plant's transpiration stream. In plants, water is transported primarily through the xylem vessels, which are part of the vascular bundles found in the root. The provided diagrams (A, B, C, D) show cross-sections of a root with vascular bundles, and a key indicating 'blue' for stained parts and 'not stained' for unstained parts.Which of the following correctly shows the condition of the section if the colour of the flowers was artificially introduced?","If the color of the flowers was artificially introduced, it would be absorbed by the plant along with water and transported through the xylem vessels in the root. Therefore, the xylem vessels in the root's vascular bundles should appear stained blue. Diagram B correctly illustrates this, showing distinct vessels (representing xylem) within the vascular bundles stained blue, while other surrounding tissues remain unstained. This pattern directly reflects the transport of the artificial color through the water-conducting tissues of the root."
"The diagram shows a cross-section of a herbaceous plant stem. Tissue P is located towards the outer part of the vascular bundle, representing the phloem. Tissue Q is located towards the inner part of the vascular bundle, representing the xylem. The plant is placed in a well-lit experimental chamber, initially with humid air, which is then replaced by dry air. Replacing humid air with dry air increases the water potential gradient between the plant and the atmosphere, thereby increasing the rate of transpiration.What are the changes in both tissues P and Q respectively?","Replacing humid air with dry air greatly increases the rate of transpiration from the plant. This increased transpiration creates a stronger 'transpiration pull' force, which directly increases the rate at which water is drawn upwards through the xylem vessels. Therefore, there would be a greatly increased upward movement of fluids in tissue Q (xylem). For tissue P (phloem), the increased water stress or altered turgor dynamics could lead to a greatly increased downward movement of fluids, perhaps due to a heightened demand for carbohydrates in the roots under these conditions, or a modified pressure gradient within the phloem itself. Thus, option C, which states a greatly increased downward movement for tissue P and a greatly increased upward movement for tissue Q, is the correct choice."
"The experimental setup investigates the products of cigarette smoke. A lighted cigarette releases smoke, which first passes through glass wool, then through ice, and finally bubbles through a pH indicator solution, driven by an air pump. After 20 minutes, a sticky brown substance, identified as tar, accumulated on the glass wool. Smoking a second cigarette led to more of this substance accumulating. The question infers that continued smoking increases the risk of a certain condition.What is the most likely condition?
A lung cancer
B increased blood clot formation
C reduced transport of oxygen by red blood cells.
D increased heart rate and blood pressure","The experiment directly demonstrates the accumulation of a 'sticky brown substance' identified as tar from cigarette smoke. Tar is a known carcinogen, meaning it contains chemicals that can cause cancer. Prolonged exposure to tar, as implied by smoking a second cigarette, significantly increases the risk of developing lung cancer by damaging lung cells and promoting uncontrolled cell growth. While smoking can contribute to other conditions listed, the direct evidence of tar accumulation specifically points to lung cancer as the most likely increased risk."
"The problem presents three diagrams (1, 2, 3) illustrating vertical sections of kidneys, highlighting the relative thickness of the cortex and medulla. Diagram 1 shows a moderately thick medulla. Diagram 2 shows a very thick medulla, extending deep into the kidney. Diagram 3 shows a thin medulla. These kidneys belong to three animals with different water conservation needs: Coypu (abundant freshwater, no water stress), Brown rat (can survive days without drinking, moderate water conservation), and Kangaroo rat (desert dwelling, no drinking, extreme water conservation). The ability of a kidney to conserve water and produce concentrated urine is directly related to the length of the Loops of Henle and collecting ducts, which are primarily located in the medulla; longer loops result in a thicker medulla.Which kidney belongs to which animal?
1, 2, 3
A brown rat, coypu, kangaroo rats
B brown rat, kangaroo rat, coypu
C kangaroo rats, brown rat, coypu
D kangaroo rats, coypu, brown rat","To match the kidneys to the animals, we correlate the medulla's thickness with the animal's need for water conservation. The kangaroo rat, living in deserts without drinking, has the highest need for water conservation, thus possessing the thickest medulla (Diagram 2). The coypu, living in freshwater, has the least need for water conservation, corresponding to the thinnest medulla (Diagram 3). The brown rat, with moderate water conservation needs, has an intermediate medulla thickness (Diagram 1). Therefore, the correct matching is: 1 = brown rat, 2 = kangaroo rat, 3 = coypu."
"The graph illustrates changes in a person's blood sugar level over a two-hour period after consuming 50g of glucose at 10:00. The x-axis shows time in a 24-hour clock format, and the y-axis shows blood sugar level in mg/100cm³ of blood. After glucose consumption, the blood sugar level rapidly increases from approximately 90 mg/100cm³ at 10:00, peaking above 130 mg/100cm³ around 10:45. It then sharply declines, reaching a minimum below 90 mg/100cm³ around 11:30, before rising slightly and stabilizing by 12:00. Insulin is a hormone secreted in response to high blood glucose to lower it, while glucagon is secreted in response to low blood glucose to raise it.At which time of the two-hour period would the secretion of insulin and glucagon increase?
increased amount of insulin, increased amount of glucagon
A 10.30, 11.00
B 10.30, 11.30
C 11.00, 10.30
D 11.30, 10.30","After consuming glucose at 10:00, blood sugar levels begin to rise significantly. Insulin secretion would increase in response to this rise, actively working to lower blood glucose. A time like 10:30, when blood glucose is clearly elevated and still climbing, is appropriate for increased insulin secretion. Following the peak and subsequent decline in blood sugar, the level reaches its lowest point around 11:30 (a hypoglycemic phase). This drop in blood glucose would stimulate the increased secretion of glucagon, which works to raise blood sugar back to normal levels. Therefore, option B, with increased insulin at 10:30 and increased glucagon at 11:30, accurately reflects these hormonal responses to the observed blood glucose changes."
"The diagram shows a cross-section of the human eye, with various structures labeled. P points to the cornea, the transparent outer layer at the front of the eye. Q points to the iris, the colored muscular diaphragm surrounding the pupil. R points to the lens, a transparent, biconvex structure located behind the iris. S points to the suspensory ligaments (part of the ciliary body), which hold the lens in place. The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye where images are formed. The primary function of the eye's refractive components is to focus incoming light rays precisely onto the retina.Which structures focus light rays onto the retina?
A P and Q
B Q and R
C R and S
D P and R","The primary structures responsible for focusing light rays onto the retina in the human eye are the cornea and the lens. The cornea (P) provides the majority of the eye's fixed refractive power, while the lens (R) provides fine-tuning and adjustable focusing (accommodation) for objects at different distances. The iris (Q) controls the amount of light entering the eye, and the suspensory ligaments (S) adjust the shape of the lens, but neither directly focuses light themselves. Therefore, P and R are the structures that focus light rays onto the retina."
"The problem describes Primula vulgaris (primrose) flowers, which exhibit different shapes adapted for pollination. Three variations are shown: 'thrum-eyed' (long style, low anthers), 'intermediate' (style and anthers at similar intermediate height), and 'pin-eyed' (short style, high anthers). Primroses are generally known to be insect-pollinated, with heterostyly (different style/anther heights) promoting cross-pollination by insects. Wind pollination and gravity pollination are alternative, typically less efficient, modes for such flower structures.Which statement(s) is/are correct?
1 The stigma of the pin-eyed primrose is able to receive pollen grains by wind.
2 The intermediate primrose is pollinated by insects.
3 The pollen grains of the thrum-eyed primrose is pollinated only by wind and gravity.
A 1 only
B 1 and 2 only
C 1 and 3 only
D 1, 2 and 3 only","Statement 1, 'The stigma of the pin-eyed primrose is able to receive pollen grains by wind,' can be considered correct in a general sense that pollen, once released, can theoretically be carried by wind to a stigma, even if the flower is not primarily adapted for wind pollination. Statement 2, 'The intermediate primrose is pollinated by insects,' is correct because primroses, including their intermediate forms, are widely known to be insect-pollinated plants. Statement 3, 'The pollen grains of the thrum-eyed primrose is pollinated only by wind and gravity,' is incorrect because primroses are primarily insect-pollinated, and the word 'only' makes this statement false. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 are correct."
"The trigeminal nerve is a cranial nerve connecting the brain to various parts of the face, including teeth and skin. The problem states that when a local anaesthetic is administered, a person can no longer feel pain in the mouth and cannot smile properly. Feeling pain is a sensory function, while smiling (muscle movement) is a motor function.What can you conclude about the trigeminal nerve?
A It contains only sensory neurons.
B It contains only relay neurons.
C It contains sensory and motor neurons.
D It contains relay and motor neurons.","The inability to feel pain after anaesthetic indicates that the trigeminal nerve carries sensory information (pain signals) from the teeth and face to the brain, implying the presence of sensory neurons. The inability to smile properly indicates that the nerve also carries motor commands from the brain to the muscles responsible for smiling, implying the presence of motor neurons. Therefore, the trigeminal nerve is a mixed nerve, containing both sensory and motor neurons."
"The question asks to identify the incorrect comparison between voluntary and reflex actions. Voluntary actions are conscious, deliberate, and often learned. Reflex actions are involuntary, automatic, and typically inborn responses. These actions differ in terms of their origin, awareness, and variability of response.Which comparison about voluntary and reflex actions is incorrect?
voluntary action, reflex action
A not inborn, inborn
B may involve a stimulus, we are not aware of the action
C we are aware of the action, we are not aware of the action
D stimulus may lead to different responses, stimulus leads to the same response","Let's analyze each comparison. A: Voluntary actions are not inborn, while reflexes are inborn; this is correct. B: Voluntary actions may involve a stimulus, and we are generally not aware of the initiation of reflex actions; this is correct. D: A stimulus for a voluntary action can lead to different responses (e.g., choosing how to react), while a stimulus for a reflex action typically leads to the same, stereotyped response; this is correct. C: For voluntary actions, 'we are aware of the action' is correct. For reflex actions, 'we are not aware of the action' is generally true for the unconscious initiation of the reflex, but we often become aware of the sensation or the bodily movement very quickly after it occurs. Therefore, the statement 'we are not aware of the action' for reflexes might be considered too absolute and thus the incorrect comparison, as awareness of the reflex's occurrence often follows rapidly."
"The question asks which of the listed events are influenced by hormones in humans. Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate various physiological processes. The events are: 1. breakdown of endometrium, 2. diffusion of glucose into cells, and 3. selective reabsorption in glomerulus.Which of the following events(s) is/are under the influence of hormones in humans?
1 breakdown of endometrium
2 diffusion of glucose into cells
3 selective reabsorption in glomerulus
A 1 only
B 1 and 2 only
C 2 and 3 only
D 1, 2 and 3","The breakdown of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) during menstruation (event 1) is directly controlled by the drop in levels of ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone). Thus, event 1 is under the influence of hormones. Diffusion of glucose into cells (event 2) is a passive process driven by a concentration gradient. While insulin (a hormone) promotes glucose uptake by increasing the number of glucose transporters in some cell types (e.g., muscle and fat cells), the fundamental process of diffusion itself is not directly 'influenced' or initiated by hormones, and some cells take up glucose via diffusion independently of insulin. Selective reabsorption (event 3) occurs primarily in the renal tubules and collecting ducts, not the glomerulus (which is involved in filtration). Hormones like ADH and aldosterone influence selective reabsorption in the tubules, but the event as stated ('in glomerulus') is anatomically incorrect for selective reabsorption. Therefore, only event 1 is clearly and accurately under the influence of hormones as described."
"The table provides genotypes (allele 1 and allele 2) and phenotypes (hair colour) for various family members (mother, father, son 1, daughter 1, son 2, daughter 2). We are told that a white streak in dark hair is caused by a dominant allele. From the mother (genotype Aa, phenotype brown) and father (genotype AA, phenotype brown), we can deduce that the allele 'A' is dominant and responsible for brown hair, and the allele 'a' is recessive and responsible for blonde hair. Therefore, genotypes AA or Aa result in brown hair, and genotype aa results in blonde hair.Which family member has the incorrect phenotype?
A daughter 1
B daughter 2
C son 1
D son 2","Based on the parental genotypes and phenotypes (Mother: Aa, brown; Father: AA, brown), it is established that 'A' is the dominant allele for brown hair, and 'a' is the recessive allele for blonde hair. Thus, individuals with genotype AA or Aa will have brown hair, and individuals with genotype aa will have blonde hair. Examining 'Son 1', his genotype is listed as Aa, but his phenotype is listed as blonde. This is incorrect, as an Aa genotype should result in brown hair, not blonde. All other family members' phenotypes are consistent with this inheritance pattern."
"The diagram shows a pyramid of numbers, representing four trophic levels labeled A (top), B, C, and D (bottom) in a woodland ecosystem. In a pyramid of numbers, the base (D) typically represents producers, followed by primary consumers (C), secondary consumers (B), and tertiary consumers (A). Woodland ecosystems are characterized by large producers like trees.At which trophic level are the individual organisms largest in body size?
A
B
C
D","In a woodland ecosystem, the base of the pyramid of numbers (trophic level D) typically consists of producers, which are often large trees. While the number of individual trees might be relatively low compared to, for example, insects (primary consumers), a single tree is by far the largest individual organism in terms of body size within that ecosystem. The individual organisms at higher trophic levels (A, B, C) are generally consumers, such as insects, birds, and mammals, which are typically smaller in individual body size than mature trees."
"The diagram illustrates the components of a sewage treatment plant. The process involves physical separation and biological treatment stages. Key components are: 1 Grit pit (physical removal of large solids), 2 Sediment tank (primary settling of suspended solids), 3 Percolating filter (biological treatment with aerobic bacteria), 4 Digester (anaerobic digestion of sludge by anaerobic bacteria), and 5 Settling tank (secondary settling to remove biological floc). Aerobic bacteria require oxygen for decomposition, while anaerobic bacteria function in the absence of oxygen.In which parts do aerobic and anaerobic bacteria become most active to help to digest sewage?
Aerobic, Anaerobic
A 3, 4
B 1, 3
C 5, 1
D 4, 2","Aerobic bacteria are most active in environments where oxygen is readily available to break down organic matter. In a sewage treatment plant, the percolating filter (part 3) is specifically designed to provide a large surface area for bacterial growth and ample aeration, making it an ideal site for aerobic digestion. Anaerobic bacteria thrive in environments lacking oxygen, and the digester (part 4) is a sealed tank used for anaerobic digestion of sludge, where these bacteria break down organic material without oxygen. Therefore, aerobic bacteria are most active in part 3, and anaerobic bacteria are most active in part 4."
"Triploid organisms are those with three sets of chromosomes (3n) instead of the normal two sets (2n). Infertility in such organisms refers to their inability to produce viable offspring. During meiosis, the process of cell division that produces gametes, homologous chromosomes must pair up precisely to form bivalents (or tetrads) in meiosis I to ensure correct segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells.Which one of the following best explains why triploid grass carps are infertile?
A Homologous chromosomes cannot pair up to form bivalents during meiosis I, thus the organism cannot form functional gametes.
B The chromosome number is too large, thus leading to sterility as gametes cannot form.
C The fishes will not survive to sexual maturity and would not produce viable offspring.
D The gametes formed would be too large to be released, thus their gametes cannot fuse to form viable zygotes.","The best explanation for the infertility of triploid organisms (3n) lies in the mechanics of meiosis. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes must pair up in a precise manner to form bivalents. In a triploid organism, there are three homologous chromosomes for each set, making accurate pairing into bivalents impossible. This irregular pairing leads to abnormal segregation of chromosomes, resulting in gametes that have an unbalanced or incorrect number of chromosomes (aneuploidy). Such gametes are typically non-functional or non-viable, hence the organism cannot produce functional gametes and is infertile."
"Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution. It describes the process by which individuals in a population that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully than those less adapted. Evolution, in turn, is the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Mutation is the source of new genetic variation, and variation refers to the differences among individuals within a population.How does natural selection contribute to the theory of evolution?
A Over time, natural selection results in changes in the inherited characteristics of a population.
B Over time, natural selection causes mutation that creates variation in a population.
C Over time, natural selection allows many different variations in a population to compete.
D Over time, natural selection acts on populations which in turn may result in the evolution of individuals.","Natural selection contributes to the theory of evolution by preferentially allowing individuals with advantageous inherited characteristics to survive and reproduce. Over successive generations, these favorable traits become more prevalent in the population, leading to a gradual shift in the population's genetic makeup and observable characteristics. This change in inherited characteristics within a population over time is precisely what defines evolution. Option A accurately describes this contribution. Options B and C misrepresent the role of natural selection, as it acts on existing variation rather than causing mutations or 'allowing' competition. Option D is incorrect because evolution occurs at the population level, not at the individual level; individuals do not evolve during their lifetime."
"Fig. 1.1 shows a food web in an ecosystem. The food web depicts several organisms and their feeding relationships. 'a flowering tree' is at the bottom, acting as a producer.

'hawks' feed on snakes and birds.Draw a pyramid of numbers for a food chain involving caterpillars.","A pyramid of numbers for a food chain involving caterpillars would typically show a large base of 'a flowering tree', a smaller level of 'caterpillars' feeding on the tree, an even smaller level of 'birds' feeding on caterpillars, and the smallest top level of 'hawks' feeding on birds. The general structure is a broad base tapering upwards, representing the decreasing number of organisms at successive trophic levels."
"Fig. 1.1 shows a food web in an ecosystem with organisms including 'a flowering tree', 'caterpillars', 'birds', and 'hawks'. A food chain involving caterpillars starts with 'a flowering tree' as the producer, followed by 'caterpillars' as primary consumers, 'birds' as secondary consumers (feeding on caterpillars), and 'hawks' as tertiary consumers (feeding on birds). Insecticides are non-biodegradable and accumulate in organisms.It is known that consumers at the highest trophic level receive the highest amount of insecticides. Based on the pyramid of numbers you have drawn in (a), explain why this is so.","Insecticides, if present in the flowering tree, are ingested by the caterpillars. These insecticides are not broken down and accumulate in the caterpillars' bodies. When birds feed on many caterpillars, the insecticides from all those caterpillars accumulate in the birds. Subsequently, when hawks feed on several birds, the concentration of insecticides becomes even higher in the hawks. This process, known as bioaccumulation or biomagnification, leads to the highest concentration of insecticides being found in organisms at the highest trophic level, such as the hawks, because they consume many organisms from lower trophic levels, and the insecticides are concentrated at each step."
"Fig. 1.1 depicts a food web where 'snakes' feed on 'grasshoppers'. 'Grasshoppers' feed on 'a flowering tree'. Other organisms in the food web include 'bees', 'caterpillars', 'birds', and 'hawks'. The flowering tree is the sole producer for all primary consumers listed.Explain the observations of the following populations when snakes are removed from this food web: The grasshopper population increases initially but decreases afterwards.","When snakes are removed from the food web, the grasshopper population initially increases because their predator, the snakes, are no longer present to hunt them. This allows grasshoppers to reproduce more successfully. However, this increased grasshopper population leads to intense competition for their food source, 'a flowering tree'. As the grasshoppers consume the flowering tree at an unsustainable rate, the food supply diminishes, causing the grasshopper population to decrease dramatically afterwards due to lack of food."
"Fig. 1.1 shows a food web where 'snakes' feed on 'grasshoppers', but not 'caterpillars'. 'Grasshoppers' and 'caterpillars' both feed on 'a flowering tree'. 'Birds' feed on 'grasshoppers' and 'caterpillars'.Explain the observations of the following populations when snakes are removed from this food web: The caterpillar population was constant for a while but decreases afterwards.","When snakes are removed, the grasshopper population increases. Both grasshoppers and caterpillars feed on the same food source, 'a flowering tree'. Initially, the caterpillar population may remain constant as snakes do not prey on them. However, with a significantly increased grasshopper population, there will be greater competition for the flowering tree, leading to a reduction in the food available for caterpillars. Additionally, with more grasshoppers available for birds to eat, the bird population might also increase, and these increased birds might then feed more on caterpillars, causing the caterpillar population to decrease afterwards."
"Fig. 2.1 displays two microscopic images of small intestine villi, presented at the same scale. The image on the left, labeled 'healthy child', shows numerous, elongated, and well-formed villi that protrude significantly into the lumen, appearing distinct and separated. The image on the right, labeled 'child patient', shows villi that are noticeably fewer in number, shorter, and appears flattened or blunted, with less protrusion into the lumen compared to the healthy child's villi.With reference to Fig. 2.1, state one difference between the villi of the healthy child and that of the patient.","With reference to Fig. 2.1, the villi of the healthy child are more numerous, longer, and protrude more significantly into the lumen compared to the child patient's villi, which appear fewer, shorter, and blunted. This indicates that the healthy child has a larger surface area provided by the villi."
"The small intestine is a digestive organ designed for efficient absorption. Beyond the macroscopic structure of villi, its microscopic and macroscopic features contribute to maximizing nutrient uptake.Describe and explain three other features of a healthy small intestine that help to maximise the absorption of digested food.","Three other features of a healthy small intestine that maximise absorption are:
1.  **Microvilli:** The epithelial cells lining the villi have microscopic folds called microvilli, which further increase the surface area to volume ratio, allowing for faster absorption of digested food.
2.  **Rich blood supply:** Each villus is richly supplied with a network of blood capillaries. This ensures that absorbed nutrients are quickly transported away, maintaining a steep concentration gradient between the small intestine lumen and the blood, which facilitates rapid diffusion.
3.  **Thin walls:** The walls of the villi are very thin, typically one cell thick. This provides a very short diffusion distance for digested food molecules to pass through from the lumen into the bloodstream."
"Fig. 3.1 shows a diagram of the male flower of a maize plant. The flower has several stamens, each consisting of an anther held by a filament. The anthers are prominent and appear to hang freely and openly from the flower, extending well beyond the main body of the flower. The petals are not visibly large or colorful, suggesting they are small or absent.With reference to Fig. 3.1, explain how two features of this flower adapt it for wind pollination.","With reference to Fig. 3.1, two features adapt this maize flower for wind pollination:
1.  **Exposed anthers:** The anthers are exposed and hang outside the flower. This allows wind to easily catch and carry away the pollen grains.
2.  **Small/no petals and large anthers:** The flower appears to have small or no showy petals, meaning less energy is invested in attracting pollinators. Instead, energy can be channeled to producing large quantities of pollen from large anthers, which is typical for wind-pollinated flowers and ensures a higher chance of successful pollination by wind."
"In corn borers, the recessive allele 'r' provides resistance to Bt toxin. The dominant allele 'R' is for susceptibility. Larvae with genotype RR (homozygous dominant) or Rr (heterozygous) are killed when they feed on Bt maize.The recessive allele, r, of the gene in corn borers confers resistance to Bt toxin. Larvae that are homozygous for the normal, dominant allele R, or that are heterozygous, are killed when they on Bt maize.

"Fig. 5.1 displays a microscopic section of lung tissue from a smoker, showing significant damage. The image reveals numerous irregular and enlarged air spaces throughout the tissue, which appear to have broken down walls. Label H specifically points to one such enlarged and irregularly shaped air space, indicating structural degradation of the tissue.Name the gas exchange structures which are damaged in Fig. 5.1.",The gas exchange structures damaged in Fig. 5.1 are the alveoli (or air sacs).
"Fig. 5.1 shows damaged lung tissue from a smoker, where label H indicates an enlarged, irregular air space formed by the breakdown of walls between gas exchange structures.Name the smoking-related disease resulting in the damaged feature labelled H in Fig. 5.1.","The smoking-related disease resulting in the damaged feature labelled H in Fig. 5.1, characterized by the breakdown of alveolar walls and formation of enlarged air spaces, is emphysema."
"Smoking is known to cause damage to the respiratory system, particularly impacting the gas exchange structures and leading to various diseases.Smoking-related diseases may increase the risk of respiratory diseases of the gas exchange system. Describe and explain how smoking can increase the risk of these diseases.","Smoking increases the risk of respiratory diseases in several ways:
1.  **Paralysis of cilia:** The tar and irritants in cigarette smoke paralyze and eventually destroy the cilia that line the air passages. Cilia normally sweep mucus, dust, and pathogens out of the respiratory tract. With paralyzed cilia, mucus and trapped particles accumulate, leading to smoker's cough and increasing the risk of infections and chronic bronchitis.
2.  **Damage to alveolar walls:** Irritants in smoke cause inflammation and damage to the walls of the alveoli, leading to their breakdown and the formation of enlarged, irregular air spaces (as seen in Fig. 5.1, feature H). This reduces the total surface area for gas exchange and leads to emphysema, making breathing difficult.
3.  **Carcinogens:** Tar in cigarette smoke contains carcinogens, which are cancer-causing chemicals. These chemicals can lead to mutations in lung cells, increasing the risk of lung cancer."
"Smokers inhale 14 to 20 mg of carbon monoxide from one cigarette. Carbon monoxide is a gas that can affect the blood's ability to transport oxygen.From one cigarette, a smoker will inhale between 14 and 20 mg of carbon monoxide. Describe the effects of carbon monoxide on haemoglobin.","Carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity for haemoglobin (about 200-250 times greater) than oxygen. When inhaled, carbon monoxide readily combines irreversibly with haemoglobin to form a stable compound called carboxyhaemoglobin. This process prevents haemoglobin from binding with oxygen, significantly reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. As a result, less oxygen is transported to the body's cells and tissues, which can lead to oxygen deprivation and various health problems."
"Fig. 6.1 is a line graph showing the estimated number of people worldwide newly infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from 1990 to 2008.

The graph includes a solid line showing the estimated number of new infections, bounded by dashed lines representing upper and lower estimates. In 1990, the estimated number of new infections was approximately 2.5 million. The number increased sharply, reaching a peak around 1996-1997 with approximately 3.5 to 3.8 million new infections. After this peak, the number shows a gradual decline, with the estimated number of new infections in 2008 being approximately 2.8 to 3 million, which is still higher than the 1990 level.Use the information in Fig. 6.1 to describe the changes in the number of people newly infected with HIV.","Based on Fig. 6.1, the number of people newly infected with HIV worldwide showed significant changes between 1990 and 2008. Initially, there was a steep increase in new infections from approximately 2.5 million in 1990, peaking around 1996-1997 at about 3.5 to 3.8 million people. Following this peak, the number of new infections gradually decreased, reaching approximately 2.8 to 3 million by 2008. Although decreasing from its peak, the number of new cases in 2008 remained higher than the number recorded in 1990."
"The global number of new HIV infections, after peaking in the mid-1990s, showed a subsequent decrease towards 2008, as observed in Fig. 6.1.Suggest the possible explanations for the decrease in the number of people newly infected with HIV.","Possible explanations for the decrease in the number of people newly infected with HIV include:
1.  **Increased awareness and education:** Global campaigns and educational initiatives have led to greater public understanding of HIV transmission methods and prevention strategies.
2.  **Safer practices:** Promotion and adoption of safer sexual practices, such as consistent condom use, and a decrease in sharing of contaminated needles among intravenous drug users.
3.  **Improved screening:** Better screening of blood products and potential blood donors has reduced transmission through transfusions.
4.  **Antiretroviral therapy (ART):** Increased access to and effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs, which can reduce the viral load in infected individuals, making them less likely to transmit the virus.
5.  **Behavioral changes:** Changes in behavior, including abstinence, or a reduction in the number of sexual partners.
These factors collectively contributed to a reduction in HIV transmission rates globally."
"Fig. 7.1 illustrates the process of genetic engineering to produce insulin. In Stage K, the insulin gene is isolated from human DNA and inserted into a bacterial plasmid. In Stage L, this transformed plasmid is introduced into a bacterium. Stage M shows the bacterium reproducing, resulting in multiple genetically identical bacteria. Stage N depicts these bacteria producing insulin.State the type of reproduction that takes place in stage M of Fig. 7.1. Use your knowledge of the process of cell division to explain why it is important that this type of reproduction occurs.","The type of reproduction that takes place in stage M of Fig. 7.1 is asexual reproduction, specifically binary fission in bacteria. It is important that this type of reproduction occurs because asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring. Since the initial bacterium in stage L has been successfully transformed with the insulin gene, asexual reproduction in stage M ensures that all subsequent bacteria produced are genetically identical clones, each containing the inserted insulin gene. This allows for the rapid and efficient production of a large number of bacteria that are all capable of producing the human hormone insulin, as shown in stage N."

"Table 8.1 provides data on the rate of photosynthesis for two different plants, Plant R and Plant S, across a range of light intensities from 5 lux to 90 lux. The light intensity is measured in lux, and the rate of photosynthesis is measured in mg carbohydrate produced per unit area per minute.
The data points are:
For Plant R: (5 lux, 2 mg/min), (10 lux, 5 mg/min), (20 lux, 9 mg/min), (30 lux, 19 mg/min), (40 lux, 23 mg/min), (50 lux, 32 mg/min), (60 lux, 42 mg/min), (70 lux, 55 mg/min), (80 lux, 72 mg/min), (90 lux, 72 mg/min).
For Plant S: (5 lux, 3 mg/min), (10 lux, 10 mg/min), (20 lux, 29 mg/min), (30 lux, 46 mg/min), (40 lux, 49 mg/min), (50 lux, 54 mg/min), (60 lux, 58 mg/min), (70 lux, 60 mg/min), (80 lux, 60 mg/min), (90 lux, 60 mg/min).
A grid is provided for plotting this data.Plot the data for all the light intensities in the range of 5 to 90 lux on the grid.","To plot the data from Table 8.1 on the provided grid:
1.  **Axes:** The x-axis should be labeled 'light intensity / lux' and range from 0 to at least 90 lux. The y-axis should be labeled 'rate of photosynthesis / mg carbohydrate produced per unit area per min' and range from 0 to at least 72 mg/min. Appropriate scales should be chosen for both axes to effectively utilize the grid space.
2.  **Plotting points:** For each plant (R and S), plot each data pair (light intensity, rate of photosynthesis) as a distinct point on the grid. For example, for Plant R, plot a point at (5, 2), then (10, 5), and so on. Do the same for Plant S.
3.  **Drawing curves:** Once all points are plotted for each plant, draw a smooth best-fit curve connecting the points for Plant R and another smooth best-fit curve for Plant S. It would be advisable to use different symbols or colors for the points and lines of each plant to distinguish them. The curves should reflect the trend of increasing photosynthesis rate with light intensity, eventually leveling off (reaching a saturation point) for both plants."
"Table 8.1 shows the rates of photosynthesis for Plant R and Plant S across various light intensities. In shady conditions, light intensity is low.
At 5 lux: Plant R = 2 mg/min, Plant S = 3 mg/min.
At 10 lux: Plant R = 5 mg/min, Plant S = 10 mg/min.
At 20 lux: Plant R = 9 mg/min, Plant S = 29 mg/min.
At 30 lux: Plant R = 19 mg/min, Plant S = 46 mg/min.
At low light intensities (e.g., 0 to 40 lux), Plant S shows a significantly higher rate of photosynthesis compared to Plant R.State, with a reason, which plant would grow best in shady conditions.","Plant S would grow best in shady conditions.
The reason is that at low light intensities, which are characteristic of shady conditions, Plant S has a significantly higher rate of photosynthesis compared to Plant R. For example, at 5 lux, Plant S produces 3 mg carbohydrate/min while Plant R produces only 2 mg carbohydrate/min. At 20 lux, Plant S produces 29 mg carbohydrate/min, whereas Plant R only produces 9 mg carbohydrate/min. This indicates that Plant S is more efficient at utilizing low light levels for photosynthesis, allowing it to produce more carbohydrates and thus grow better in shade."
"Table 8.1 shows that for both Plant R and Plant S, the rate of photosynthesis reaches a plateau at light intensities above 80 lux (72 mg/min for R at 80/90 lux, 60 mg/min for S at 70/80/90 lux). This indicates that light intensity is no longer the limiting factor for photosynthesis at these high levels. Carbon dioxide is a raw material for photosynthesis.Explain why, at light intensity above 80 lux, the rate of photosynthesis in both plants might increase if they were: supplied with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide.","At light intensities above 80 lux, the rate of photosynthesis for both plants has reached its maximum for those light conditions, meaning light intensity is no longer the limiting factor. Photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide as a raw material. If the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air is low, it becomes the new limiting factor, restricting the rate at which photosynthesis can proceed, even with abundant light. Therefore, supplying higher concentrations of carbon dioxide would overcome this limitation, allowing the Calvin cycle reactions to proceed faster and consequently increasing the overall rate of photosynthesis in both plants."
"Fig. 9.1 displays a longitudinal section of the human heart, showing its four chambers and associated valves. The 'right atrium', 'atrio-ventricular valve', and 'right ventricle' are labeled. Observing the ventricular walls, the wall of the left ventricle (the lower chamber on the left side of the diagram, opposite the right ventricle) appears noticeably thicker and more muscular than the wall of the right ventricle.Explain the difference in the thickness of the left ventricle and the right ventricle.","The left ventricle has a significantly thicker and more muscular wall compared to the right ventricle because it needs to generate a much greater pressure to pump oxygenated blood to the entire body (systemic circulation). This involves pushing blood through a long network of arteries, capillaries, and veins. In contrast, the right ventricle only needs to pump deoxygenated blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation), which is a shorter distance and requires less pressure to avoid damaging the delicate alveolar capillaries. Therefore, the greater muscular mass of the left ventricle allows it to develop the necessary force for systemic circulation."
"Fig. 9.1 shows a longitudinal section of the human heart, with labeled structures including the 'right atrium', 'atrio-ventricular valve', and 'right ventricle'. The atrio-ventricular valve is positioned between the right atrium and the right ventricle.Explain how the structures labelled in Fig. 9.1 ensure that blood flows in the correct direction.","The 'atrio-ventricular valve' (specifically the tricuspid valve in the right side of the heart, as labeled in Fig. 9.1) plays a crucial role in ensuring unidirectional blood flow. When the right atrium contracts and the pressure within it becomes greater than that in the right ventricle, the atrio-ventricular valve opens, allowing blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. However, when the right ventricle contracts, the pressure inside the ventricle rapidly increases and becomes higher than the pressure in the atrium. This pressure difference forces the atrio-ventricular valve to close firmly, preventing blood from flowing back into the right atrium. Instead, the contracting ventricle forces the blood forward into the pulmonary artery (not explicitly labeled but implied as the exit vessel from the right ventricle), ensuring that blood moves in the correct direction through the heart."
Coronary arteries are blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle itself. Atherosclerosis is a condition involving the hardening and narrowing of arteries due to plaque buildup.Outline the effects of atherosclerosis in coronary arteries and the resulting effects on the heart itself.,"Atherosclerosis in coronary arteries begins with the deposition of fatty substances, cholesterol, and other materials on the inner walls of these arteries, forming plaques. This plaque buildup causes the artery walls to thicken and harden, and crucially, it narrows the lumen (the internal passageway) of the coronary arteries. This narrowing significantly reduces the blood flow to the heart muscle. Consequently, the heart muscle receives an insufficient supply of oxygen and glucose, which are vital for aerobic respiration to produce energy for its continuous pumping action. This deprivation can lead to symptoms like angina (chest pain). If the blood flow is severely restricted or completely blocked, it can result in a myocardial infarction (heart attack) where part of the heart muscle dies due to lack of oxygen, or can lead to heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs."
Physiological processes in living organisms are often regulated by control mechanisms to maintain stable internal conditions.Explain what is meant by control by 'negative feedback'.,"Control by 'negative feedback' is a regulatory mechanism where a change in a regulated variable (e.g., body temperature, blood glucose level) triggers a response that counteracts the initial change, thereby bringing the variable back towards its set point or normal level. Essentially, the output of the system inhibits its own input. For example, if body temperature rises above normal, negative feedback mechanisms (like sweating and vasodilation) are activated to lower the temperature. Conversely, if body temperature falls below normal, mechanisms (like shivering and vasoconstriction) are activated to raise it. This continuous loop ensures stability and maintains homeostasis."
"The carbon cycle describes the movement of carbon through different components of an ecosystem. Producers, such as plants, convert carbon dioxide into organic matter.Explain how carbon, in the form of organic matter in the producer, flows through the ecosystem.","Carbon, initially fixed by producers (like plants) in the form of organic matter (such as starch, proteins, and cellulose) through photosynthesis, flows through the ecosystem as follows:
1.  **Consumption by primary consumers:** When primary consumers (herbivores) feed on the producers, the organic carbon from the plant tissues is transferred and incorporated into the body tissues of the primary consumers.
2.  **Consumption by higher trophic levels:** This carbon then moves up the food chain as secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers, with carbon being assimilated into their respective organic compounds.
3.  **Respiration:** At each trophic level (producers, consumers), organisms carry out respiration, breaking down organic compounds to release energy. During this process, carbon is released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
4.  **Death and decomposition:** When any organism dies, or when waste products are egested, the organic matter containing carbon is broken down by decomposers (bacteria and fungi). These decomposers also respire, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.
5.  **Fossilization (long-term cycle):** Under specific conditions, dead organic matter can be converted over millions of years into fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas), storing carbon for long periods. The combustion of these fossil fuels by humans releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
This continuous cycling ensures carbon is reused within the ecosystem, although some is lost to the atmosphere and stored in long-term reservoirs."
"Energy flows through an ecosystem, primarily originating from the sun and captured by producers. Unlike matter, energy does not cycle in the same way.Explain why energy has to be constantly supplied to the ecosystem.","Energy has to be constantly supplied to the ecosystem primarily because energy flow is unidirectional and, at each trophic level, a significant portion of energy is lost, mainly as heat, and cannot be recycled.
1.  **Energy loss during metabolic processes:** Organisms at every trophic level (producers, consumers, decomposers) perform metabolic activities like respiration to sustain life. During these processes, chemical energy stored in organic molecules is converted into usable forms, but a large amount is inevitably lost as heat to the environment due to the second law of thermodynamics. This heat energy cannot be recaptured or reused by organisms to do work.
2.  **Inefficient transfer between trophic levels:** Only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next; the rest is lost as heat, undigested food (egested materials), or unconsumed parts of organisms.
3.  **Unusable chemical energy:** Energy contained in dead organic matter or waste products (egested/excreted materials) is also released as heat by decomposers, and once it dissipates as heat, it's no longer available to fuel biological processes in the ecosystem.
Therefore, to sustain life and the functioning of the ecosystem, a continuous input of energy, typically from the sun, is required to compensate for these constant losses."

Molecule B is a long, wavy, coiled chain (representing protein). Molecule C is a chain of smaller units and some individual units (representing disaccharides/monosaccharides, or fats). After full digestion and absorption, the lacteal absorbs fatty acids and glycerol, while the blood capillary absorbs glucose and amino acids. Therefore, the lacteal should show smaller, distinct units of fatty acids and glycerol, and the blood capillary should show small hexagonal units (glucose) and small oval units (amino acids).On Fig. 1.1, draw and label the molecules as they would appear after they have been fully digested and then absorbed by the lacteal and by the blood capillary.","In the lacteal, draw small, distinct units representing fatty acids and glycerol, and label them as fatty acids and glycerol.

"Fig. 3.1 is a line graph showing the volume of blood in the left ventricle (cm³) on the y-axis, against time (s) on the x-axis. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 140 cm³, and the x-axis from 0 to 1.0 s. The graph shows the volume decreasing from approximately 60 cm³ at 0s to 50 cm³ at 0.1s. It then rapidly increases to approximately 130 cm³ at 0.4s. Following this, the volume decreases to approximately 45 cm³ at 0.6s, then increases again to approximately 120 cm³ at 0.9s, and finally decreases to 60 cm³ at 1.0s.

Table 4.1 shows that arteries have a substantial layer of elastic tissue (370 µm thick) as part of their wall structure. This elastic tissue is crucial for the artery's function in blood circulation.Explain how the elastic tissue in the wall helps to even out the pressure of blood flowing through the artery.,"The elastic tissue in the artery wall stretches when blood surges through at high pressure during ventricular contraction (systole). It then recoils during ventricular relaxation (diastole), which helps to maintain a continuous blood flow and smooth out the pressure fluctuations, preventing extreme peaks and troughs in blood pressure."
"Fig. 5.1 includes data for the rate of transpiration over a 24-hour period. From the given table, the rate of transpiration is 5 AU at 6h, 30 AU at 12h, and 40 AU at 18h. This shows a significant increase in transpiration rate from 6 AM to 6 PM (18h). This period corresponds to daylight hours.Suggest a reason for the changes in the rate of transpiration between the 6th and 18th hour period.","Between the 6th and 18th hour period, the rate of transpiration increases significantly. This is likely due to environmental factors associated with daytime, such as an increase in temperature, increased light intensity, or increased wind speed, all of which enhance the rate of evaporation of water from the plant. A decrease in humidity during daytime would also contribute to a higher transpiration rate."
"Fig. 5.1 shows a pre-plotted curve for 'Diameter of branch (A.U.)' and a table of data for 'Rate of transpiration (A.U.)' to be plotted, both against 'Time / h'. Observing the plotted branch diameter curve, it is at its maximum (approx. 38 A.U.) around 6h and its minimum (approx. 20 A.U.) around 18h. From the table, the rate of transpiration is at its minimum (5 A.U.) at 6h and its maximum (40 A.U.) at 18h.With reference to Fig. 5.1, describe the effect of transpiration on the diameter of the branch.","As the rate of transpiration increases, the diameter of the branch decreases. This is evident from the graph, for example, at 6 hours, the transpiration rate is low (5 A.U.), and the branch diameter is large (approximately 38 A.U.). Conversely, at 18 hours, the transpiration rate is high (40 A.U.), and the branch diameter is at its minimum (approximately 20 A.U.). This inverse relationship occurs because high transpiration leads to more water loss, causing cells in the branch to lose turgor pressure, thus reducing the branch's diameter."
"Fig. 6.1 is a micrograph of a section of the pancreas. It distinctly shows a cluster of cells within a circle labeled 'A'. These cells in cluster A appear morphologically different from the surrounding pancreatic tissue, being typically lighter and more compact. The pancreas is known for both exocrine (digestive enzymes) and endocrine (hormones) functions, with specific cell types responsible for hormone secretion.Suggest the identity of the cells in circle A.",The cells in circle A are the Islets of Langerhans. These are the endocrine clusters within the pancreas responsible for producing hormones like insulin and glucagon.
"Fig. 6.1 shows the Islets of Langerhans (labeled A) within the pancreas. These cells are specialized to secrete hormones that regulate blood glucose levels, thereby maintaining a constant internal environment (homeostasis).With reference to Fig. 6.1, describe in detail how these cells carry out a function in maintaining a constant, internal environment.","The Islets of Langerhans (cells in A) monitor blood glucose levels. If blood glucose increases, they secrete more insulin directly into the bloodstream. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose by cells and its conversion to glycogen in the liver and muscles, lowering blood glucose. If blood glucose decreases, they secrete more glucagon directly into the bloodstream. Glucagon stimulates the conversion of stored glycogen back to glucose in the liver, releasing it into the blood and raising blood glucose levels. This continuous regulation keeps the internal environment constant."
"Premature babies have characteristics that make them susceptible to rapid heat loss and difficulty maintaining body temperature. One such characteristic is their smaller size, which affects their surface area to volume ratio.Explain how each characteristic makes it necessary for the baby to be kept warm in an incubator: smaller size.","A smaller size results in a larger surface area to volume ratio. This means premature babies lose heat to the surroundings at a faster rate compared to full-term babies, making it essential to keep them in a warm environment like an incubator to prevent hypothermia."
"Premature babies have characteristics that make them susceptible to rapid heat loss and difficulty maintaining body temperature. One such characteristic is their thin skin with prominent blood vessels, which influences heat exchange with the environment.Explain how each characteristic makes it necessary for the baby to be kept warm in an incubator: thin skin with prominent blood vessels.","With thin skin and prominent blood vessels, the blood vessels are closer to the surface of the skin. This increases the rate at which heat is lost from the baby's body to the environment through conduction, convection, and radiation, necessitating external warming in an incubator."
"Premature babies have characteristics that make them susceptible to rapid heat loss and difficulty maintaining body temperature. One such characteristic is a poorly developed shivering response, which is a key mechanism for heat generation.Explain how each characteristic makes it necessary for the baby to be kept warm in an incubator: poorly developed shivering response.","Shivering is a physiological response involving rapid muscle contractions to generate heat. A poorly developed shivering response means that premature babies cannot generate sufficient heat metabolically when exposed to cold, making them highly dependent on external heat sources like an incubator to maintain their body temperature."
"Fig. 8.1 shows five drawings of a cell at various stages of mitosis. 
A: Cell with a distinct, intact nucleus and diffuse chromatin, representing Interphase.
B: Cell with two separated sets of decondensing chromosomes at opposite poles, with new nuclear membranes forming, representing Telophase.
C: Cell with condensed, tangled chromosomes and a broken-down nuclear membrane, representing Prophase.
D: Cell where sister chromatids are pulled apart towards opposite poles, forming V-shapes, representing Anaphase.
E: Cell with condensed chromosomes aligned along the metaphase plate, each consisting of two sister chromatids, representing Metaphase.List the letters shown in Fig. 8.1 in the order in which these stages occur during a mitotic cell cycle.","A (Interphase), C (Prophase), E (Metaphase), D (Anaphase), B (Telophase).
So, the order is: A, C, E, D, B."
"Fig. 8.1, stage A, shows a cell with a distinct, intact nucleus containing diffuse chromatin. This is characteristic of the interphase stage of the cell cycle, which precedes actual cell division.With reference to Fig. 8.1, explain what is happening in stage A.","Stage A represents Interphase, a period of growth and preparation for cell division. During this stage, the cell replicates its DNA and doubles its chromosomes, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of genetic material."
"Fig. 8.1, stage D, shows a cell where distinct V-shaped structures (chromatids) are being pulled towards opposite ends of the cell. This is characteristic of the anaphase stage of mitosis.With reference to Fig. 8.1, explain what is happening in stage D.","Stage D represents Anaphase. During this stage, the sister chromatids of each chromosome separate at the centromere and are pulled / migrate towards opposite poles of the cell by the shortening spindle fibers."
"The question asks about the importance of mitosis for growth in multicellular organisms. Mitosis is a type of cell division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell.State the importance of mitosis in the growth of a multicellular organism, such as a flowering plant or a mammal.","Mitosis is crucial for the growth of multicellular organisms because it produces genetically identical cells, allowing for the increase in cell number necessary for tissue and organ development. It ensures the maintenance of genetic stability, where daughter cells receive the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent cell, with no genetic variation, which is essential for maintaining the organism's form and function."
"Fig. 8.2 is a diagram drawn from a photomicrograph of an animal cell undergoing meiosis. The diagram shows what appears to be two distinct clusters of chromosomes, suggesting two separate cells or a cell in the process of dividing, where individual chromosomes (each still composed of two sister chromatids) are aligned along metaphase plates. This indicates that a prior meiotic division (Meiosis I) has already occurred, reducing the chromosome number by half.Identify the stage of meiosis shown in Fig. 8.2.",Metaphase II.
"The question asks how meiosis leads to variation within species. Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four haploid gametes (sex cells) from a single diploid cell, and it is a key process for sexual reproduction.Explain briefly how meiosis leads to variation within species.","Meiosis leads to variation within species through several mechanisms:
1. Independent assortment of homologous chromosomes: During Metaphase I, homologous chromosomes align randomly at the metaphase plate, leading to different combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes in the daughter cells.
2. Crossing over: In Prophase I, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, creating new combinations of alleles on the chromatids.
3. Random fertilisation: The fusion of any one of the millions of possible male gametes with any one of the millions of possible female gametes further increases genetic variation in the offspring."
The violet (Viola odorata) is a flowering plant species that has some flowers which never open and are self-pollinated. Self-pollination is a reproductive strategy where pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or to another flower on the same plant.Suggest two advantages of plants having flowers that self-pollinate.,"Two advantages of self-pollination are:
1. It ensures a higher probability of pollination and thus higher success rate of seed production, especially when pollinators are scarce or absent, or when flowers are never open.
2. It reduces wastage of pollen and saves energy in producing large quantities of pollen, as the pollen does not need to be carried over long distances.
3. It reduces the need for external agents of pollination like wind or insects."
"Fig. 9.1 shows a photograph of Ophrys scolopax, an orchid species, with a male bee or wasp attempting to mate with the flower. The flowers of this species are known to visually and chemically (scent) mimic female bees or wasps to attract males for pollination, a strategy known as mimicry.Explain an advantage of mimicry.","An advantage of mimicry in plants like Ophrys scolopax is that it attracts specific pollinators (male bees/wasps in this case) more effectively. When the male insect attempts to mate with the flower, it inadvertently picks up or deposits pollen, thereby facilitating the transfer of pollen among the same type of species and ensuring successful pollination."
"Fig. 10.1 is a diagram of the carbon cycle, illustrating how carbon moves between different reservoirs in the environment. It shows reservoirs such as 'carbon dioxide in the air', 'carbohydrates and proteins in dead organic matter', 'carbohydrates and proteins in animals', 'carbon compounds in fossil fuels e.g. oil and coal', and 'carbohydrates and proteins in green plants'. Unlabeled arrows indicate various processes.On Fig. 10.1, label arrows with suitable letters (provided below) that represent the following processes:
(i) combustion – letter C,
(ii) decomposition – letter D,
(iii) photosynthesis – letter P,
(iv) respiration – letter R.","(i) Combustion (C) labels the arrow from 'carbon compounds in fossil fuels e.g. oil and coal' to 'carbon dioxide in the air'.

(iii) Photosynthesis (P) labels the arrow from 'carbon dioxide in the air' to 'carbohydrates and proteins in green plants'.
(iv) Respiration (R) labels the arrow from 'carbohydrates and proteins in green plants' to 'carbon dioxide in the air' and the arrow from 'carbohydrates and proteins in animals' to 'carbon dioxide in the air'."
"Fig. 10.1 illustrates the carbon cycle, showing various reservoirs where carbon is stored (e.g., carbon dioxide in the air, plants, fossil fuels, dead organic matter). The question asks for the definition of a carbon sink.State what is meant by the term carbon sink.","A carbon sink is a natural or artificial reservoir that absorbs and stores more carbon (typically carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) than it releases. Examples include oceans, forests, and certain types of soil, which are able to store large amounts of carbon dioxide, potentially indefinitely."
"Fig. 10.1 represents the carbon cycle, showing the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, living organisms, dead organic matter, and fossil fuels. Forests play a significant role in this cycle, primarily through photosynthesis. Deforestation is the clearing of forests.Describe two effects of deforestation that will impact the carbon cycle.","Two effects of deforestation on the carbon cycle are:
1. Reduced photosynthesis: With fewer trees and plants, there is a significant reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, leading to an increase in atmospheric CO2 levels.
2. Increased carbon emissions: When forests are cleared, the felled trees are often burned or left to decompose. Both processes release stored carbon (as carbon dioxide and methane) back into the atmosphere, further contributing to higher atmospheric CO2 levels."
"The question asks for an outline of the mechanism of dialysis, which is a medical procedure used to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when a person's kidneys fail.Outline the mechanism of dialysis in the case of kidney failure.","In dialysis, blood is withdrawn from the patient (typically from a vein) and circulated through a dialysis machine. Inside the dialyzer, the blood flows on one side of a partially permeable membrane, while a specialized dialysis fluid (dialysate) flows on the other side. The dialysate contains optimal concentrations of essential substances like glucose and mineral salts, but no metabolic waste products like urea. Due to concentration gradients, waste products (like urea, creatinine, excess salts) and excess water diffuse from the blood, across the membrane, into the dialysate. Essential substances like glucose are prevented from leaving the blood or may even diffuse into the blood if their concentration is too low. To maximize efficiency, the blood and dialysate flow in opposite directions (counter-current flow) across a large surface area provided by highly coiled or folded tubing."
"The human eye is capable of accommodation, which is the process of changing the focal length of the lens to focus on objects at different distances onto the retina, thus allowing for clear vision.Describe how the eye is able to see objects clearly at different distances.","To see **distant objects** clearly: The ciliary muscles relax, causing the suspensory ligaments to become taut. This pulls on the edges of the lens, making it thinner and less convex. Consequently, the lens's focal length increases, ensuring that parallel light rays from distant objects are sharply focused onto the retina. 
To see **near objects** clearly: The ciliary muscles contract, releasing tension on the suspensory ligaments. This allows the elastic lens to become thicker and more convex due to its natural elasticity. This change decreases the lens's focal length, ensuring that diverging light rays from nearby objects are sharply focused onto the retina. 
In both cases, once light is focused on the retina, photoreceptors are stimulated, and nerve impulses are transmitted via the optic nerve to the brain, which then interprets these impulses as a clear image."
"Table 12.1 shows the results of a field test for a patient's eye. For Area C, the patient detected 0 points of light at all tested intensities (1 dim, 2, 3, 4 bright). Fig. 12.1 is a photograph of the patient's retina, where Area C is identified as the optic disc, a specific region on the retina.Explain the results for Area C.","Area C corresponds to the optic disc, which is the point where the optic nerve leaves the retina and blood vessels enter and exit the eye. This region is also known as the blind spot. The reason no points of light were detected in Area C, regardless of intensity, is that there are no photoreceptors (rods or cones) present in this part of the retina, making it insensitive to light."
"Table 12.1 shows the results for Area B. For light intensity of 2 units, the patient detected 4 out of 5 points of light, meaning one point was not detected. Area B represents the peripheral retina, which contains photoreceptors.Area B detected points of light at all of the light intensities tested. Suggest one reason why, at light intensity of 2 units, one of the points of light was not detected.","One reason why one point of light at intensity 2 was not detected in Area B could be that the patient blinked, momentarily looked in a slightly different direction, or was momentarily distracted when that specific point of light appeared. These actions could prevent the light from reaching the retina or the patient from consciously registering it."
The question concerns the optometrist's advice on using sunglasses with UV protection when outdoors in the sun. This relates to general eye health and the potential harm from solar radiation.The optometrist advised the patient on the importance of using sunglasses with UV protection when he is out in the sun. Suggest an explanation why UV protection in sunglasses is important.,"UV protection in sunglasses is important because it blocks harmful / excessive ultraviolet (UV) rays and intense sunlight from reaching the eyes. Prolonged exposure to UV radiation can cause significant damage to the eye, specifically leading to conditions such as damage to the retina, cataracts (clouding of the eye lens), and potentially increasing the risk of certain cancers in and around the eye."
Wolfram syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the CISD2 gene. This genetic defect manifests as early-onset diabetes and deafness in affected individuals.Describe how mutation of the CISD2 gene is responsible for Wolfram syndrome.,"A mutation in the CISD2 gene leads to an alteration in its DNA sequence. This change in the gene sequence results in the production of a faulty or non-functional polypeptide (protein). This abnormal protein then leads to a specific phenotype or set of traits, which in this case are the symptoms of Wolfram syndrome, such as early-onset diabetes and deafness."
"The decline of the white-backed vulture population is linked to the consumption of carcasses from farm animals that had been treated with a particular painkiller drug. This drug is described as non-biodegradable and causes kidney failure in the vultures. Farmers continued to use up their stocks of the drug even after it was being phased out.With reference to the explanation on the previous page, explain what is meant by the term 'bioaccumulation' and 'bioamplification'.","Bioaccumulation refers to the build-up of the non-biodegradable painkiller drug or other chemicals within the tissues of an individual organism over its lifetime. In this case, the painkiller drug accumulates in the tissues of the farm animals that consume it and is not readily excreted. 
Bioamplification (or biomagnification) describes the increasing concentration of the painkiller drug as it moves up successive trophic levels in a food chain. Vultures, being top predators, consume many carcasses of farm animals (which have bioaccumulated the drug). To meet their energy needs, they must eat a large quantity of these contaminated carcasses, leading to a significantly higher and often lethal concentration of the drug in their own bodies compared to lower trophic levels, ultimately causing kidney failure."
"The white-backed vulture population is critically endangered, having fallen by 97%. A captive breeding program (ex situ conservation) has been established, with three centers housing up to 40 vultures collected from various areas of the Indian subcontinent. The threat in the wild is from a non-biodegradable painkiller drug in animal carcasses that causes kidney failure, and farmers continue to use existing stocks.Explain why the decision was made to conserve the species in captivity (ex situ) rather than in the wild (in situ).","Ex situ conservation (in captivity) was chosen over in situ conservation (in the wild) for several reasons:
1. Direct threat in the wild: The primary cause of the population decline, the painkiller drug, is still present in the environment as farmers use up their existing stocks, making the wild a dangerous place for vultures.
2. Controlled environment: In captivity, vultures can be fed uncontaminated food, ensuring they are not exposed to the harmful drug.
3. Health management: The health of individual vultures can be closely monitored, and they can receive immediate treatment for diseases.
4. Enhanced reproduction: Breeding can be manipulated, and eggs can be artificially incubated, with young being hand-reared, which significantly increases survival rates compared to natural conditions where mortality is high.
5. Protection from other threats: Captivity protects the vultures from hunting, predation, and reduces inter-species competition, giving them a better chance of survival and reproduction."
"The white-backed vulture (Gyps benganalensis) population has drastically declined, making it critically endangered. These vultures play an ecological role as scavengers.Outline three reasons why conservation of the white-backed vulture is important.","Conservation of the white-backed vulture is important for several reasons:
1. Ecological role as scavengers: Vultures play a crucial role in ecosystems by consuming animal carcasses. This prevents the spread of diseases from decaying matter, maintains ecosystem hygiene, and prevents the proliferation of other scavengers like feral dogs, which can pose risks to human health.
2. Maintaining biodiversity: Conserving the vulture contributes to maintaining overall biodiversity. Each species has a unique ecological niche, and its loss can have cascading negative effects throughout the ecosystem.
3. Genetic diversity and future resilience: Maintaining a viable population, even in captivity, helps to preserve the species' genetic variation and gene pool. This genetic diversity is vital for the species' long-term adaptability and resilience against future threats, diseases, or environmental changes, and reduces the risk of inbreeding."
"No specific context is provided besides the definitions requested. A polypeptide is a straight or unfolded molecule composed of a sequence of amino acids. A protein is a folded form of a polypeptide that possesses a specific three-dimensional structure, enabling it to perform a specific biological function.Differentiate between: a polypeptide and a protein.","A polypeptide is a straight or unfolded molecule made up of a sequence of amino acids. A protein is a folded form of a polypeptide which performs a specific biological function, often due to specific folding patterns."
"No specific context is provided besides the definitions requested. Glycogen, glucagon, and glycerol are distinct biological molecules. Glycogen serves as an energy storage polysaccharide in animals. Glucagon is a hormone involved in blood glucose regulation. Glycerol is a simple polyol compound that is a component of lipids.Differentiate between: glycogen, glucagon and glycerol.","Glycogen is a polysaccharide, serving as a storage form of glucose or sugar in animals, primarily in the liver and muscles. Glucagon is a hormone, produced by the pancreas, which breaks down glycogen to glucose during homeostasis to raise blood glucose levels. Glycerol is a small organic molecule that is an alcohol and forms the backbone of fats (triglycerides) when combined with fatty acids."
"The graph, labeled Fig. 2.1, displays the effect of temperature on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction in an aquatic green plant, Elodea. The x-axis represents Temperature in °C, ranging from 0 to 60. The y-axis represents the rate of reaction, ranging from 0 to 100. The curve shows that the reaction rate is low at 0°C, gradually increases to a maximum rate of approximately 95 units at an optimal temperature of approximately 40°C, and then sharply decreases, indicating enzyme denaturation at higher temperatures, reaching a low rate near 60°C. The question asks to sketch a new graph on this existing figure.Sketch, on Fig. 2.1, the graph showing the rate of carbon dioxide absorbed by Elodea from its surrounding over the same range of temperature, when light intensity is reduced 50% from before.","When light intensity is reduced by 50%, the rate of carbon dioxide absorption by Elodea, which is a measure of photosynthesis, will decrease. Therefore, the sketched graph should maintain the same general bell-shaped trend as the original curve, indicating an optimal temperature for the enzymes. However, all reaction rates, including the peak rate, should be lower than those on the original graph, reflecting the limiting effect of reduced light intensity."
"The graph, labeled Fig. 2.1, displays the effect of temperature on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction in an aquatic green plant, Elodea. The x-axis represents Temperature in °C, ranging from 0 to 60. The y-axis represents the rate of reaction, ranging from 0 to 100. The curve shows that the reaction rate peaks at an optimal temperature of approximately 40°C and then sharply decreases at higher temperatures. A second hypothetical graph (as described in Q2a) would show a similar trend but with lower reaction rates across the entire temperature range due to reduced light intensity. At 50°C, the original graph shows a significantly reduced rate of reaction compared to its optimum.Explain the relationship of the two graphs at temperature 50°C.","At 50°C, for both the original graph (showing the effect of temperature on enzyme reaction rate) and the hypothetical graph (representing the rate of carbon dioxide absorption with 50% reduced light intensity), the rate of reaction is significantly lower than their respective optimal rates. This is because at 50°C, the enzymes involved in the reactions, particularly photosynthesis, start to denature due to the high temperature. Denaturation alters the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme's active site, reducing its ability to bind to substrates. Consequently, fewer enzyme-substrate complexes are formed per unit time, leading to a decrease in the rate of product formation. The graph representing reduced light intensity would show an even lower reaction rate at 50°C compared to the original graph, as both high temperature and limited light intensity act as limiting factors."
"The graph, labeled Fig. 2.1, displays the effect of temperature on the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction in an aquatic green plant, Elodea. The x-axis represents Temperature in °C, ranging from 0 to 60. The y-axis represents the rate of reaction, ranging from 0 to 100. Between 20°C and 30°C, the graph shows a significant increase in the rate of reaction, indicating that the enzymes are becoming more active within this temperature range.Explain, using the 'lock and key' hypothesis, the increase in rate of enzyme activity between 20°C and 30°C.","According to the 'lock and key' hypothesis, enzymes (the 'locks') have specific active sites that are complementary in shape to their substrate molecules (the 'keys'). As the temperature increases from 20°C to 30°C, both the enzyme and substrate molecules gain more kinetic energy. This increased kinetic energy causes the molecules to move faster and collide more frequently with each other. Consequently, there is a higher frequency of successful collisions where the substrate binds precisely to the enzyme's active site, forming enzyme-substrate complexes. This increased formation of complexes directly leads to a faster rate of product formation, thus explaining the observed increase in enzyme activity within this temperature range."
"The question asks for an explanation regarding the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs, specifically comparing a large number of small alveoli versus a smaller number of larger alveoli. The alveoli are the primary sites for gas exchange in the lungs.A large number of small alveoli is more efficient in gas exchange than a smaller number of larger alveoli. Explain why.","A large number of small alveoli provides a significantly larger total surface area for gas exchange compared to a smaller number of larger alveoli of the same total volume. A larger total surface area is a crucial adaptive feature for efficient gas exchange because it allows more oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules to diffuse across the respiratory surface per unit time, thereby increasing the overall rate and efficiency of gas absorption and elimination."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 3.1, illustrates a cross-section of an alveolus and an adjacent capillary. It shows Cell layer A (alveolar epithelium) with a thickness of 0.04 µm – 0.2 µm and Cell layer B (capillary endothelium) with a thickness of 0.05 µm – 0.3 µm. These two cell layers form part of the barrier through which gases must diffuse for efficient exchange between the air space in the alveolus and the blood in the capillary.State the common adaptive feature of both cell layers A and B to increase efficiency of gas exchange.","Both cell layers A and B are extremely thin, being only one cell thick. This thinness significantly reduces the diffusion distance for gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), thereby increasing the rate and efficiency of gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 3.1, shows the thicknesses of the layers involved in gas exchange between the blood plasma and the air space in the alveolus. Cell layer A (alveolar epithelium) has a thickness ranging from 0.04 µm to 0.2 µm. The Space between cell layers (interstitial fluid) has a thickness of 0.02 µm. Cell layer B (capillary endothelium) has a thickness ranging from 0.05 µm to 0.3 µm. A molecule of carbon dioxide must diffuse across these three layers.What is the minimum distance a molecule of carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood plasma to the air space in the alveolus?","To determine the minimum diffusion distance, we sum the minimum thicknesses of the three layers: Cell layer A (minimum 0.04 µm) + Space between cell layers (0.02 µm) + Cell layer B (minimum 0.05 µm). The minimum total distance is 0.04 µm + 0.02 µm + 0.05 µm = 0.11 µm."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 4.1, shows two types of cells involved in the body's defense. Cell X is an irregularly shaped cell with a plasma membrane and containing several vesicles within its cytoplasm. Cell Y is a more regularly shaped, generally circular cell with a plasma membrane, lacking the prominent vesicles seen in Cell X. In the context of preventing infection, Cell X represents a phagocyte (e.g., macrophage) and Cell Y represents a lymphocyte (e.g., B lymphocyte or T lymphocyte), both playing crucial roles in the immune response.Explain how cell X and Y may work together to prevent infection after an operation.","After an operation, if an infection occurs, Cell Y (a lymphocyte, specifically a B lymphocyte) can be activated to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells, which then produce specific antibodies. These antibodies circulate in the blood and can bind to the invading germs (pathogens), leading to their agglutination (clumping), neutralization of their toxins, or opsonization (marking them for destruction). Cell X (a phagocyte like a macrophage or neutrophil) then recognizes and engulfs these antibody-coated germs, as well as other foreign particles or cellular debris, through a process called phagocytosis. Inside Cell X, the ingested pathogens are broken down and destroyed. Thus, Cell Y provides specific humoral immunity by marking pathogens, while Cell X provides cellular immunity and cleanup by destroying them, working cooperatively to prevent and clear infection."
"Blood clots play a vital role in preventing infection by sealing wounds and acting as a physical barrier. This process involves several components of the blood, including specialized cell fragments called platelets.Blood clot also protects infection by forming a plaque on the wound. Briefly explain how blood platelets help to form blood clot.","When a blood vessel is damaged, blood platelets are activated and adhere to the exposed collagen fibers at the site of injury. These activated platelets then release various factors, including thrombokinase (also known as Factor Xa). Thrombokinase, along with other clotting factors from damaged cells, initiates a cascade of reactions that converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin, in turn, acts as an enzyme to convert the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin monomers. These fibrin monomers then polymerize to form a mesh-like network of fibrin strands. This fibrin mesh traps more platelets, red blood cells, and other blood components, forming a stable blood clot or plaque that seals the wound, stops bleeding, and physically prevents the entry of pathogens, thereby protecting against infection."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 5.1, outlines the process of In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF). The diagram includes a representation of the female reproductive system with a Fallopian tube, Ovary, and Uterus labeled. IVF involves extracting eggs, fertilizing them in a culture dish (Step 3), and then implanting the resulting embryos into the uterus (Step 5). This contrasts with natural conception.State the part of the female reproductive organ where fertilisation normally occurs instead of culture dish in IVF.","Fertilisation normally occurs in the Fallopian tube (or oviduct) in the female reproductive organ, as opposed to a culture dish in IVF."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 5.1, illustrates the process of In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), where eggs are mixed with sperm in a culture dish for fertilization (Step 3). Fertilization involves the combination of genetic material from two distinct gametes. The question asks to explain why the resulting embryos are not clones of their parents.Explain why the embryos formed using IVF are not clone of their parents.","The embryos formed using IVF are not clones of their parents because fertilisation still takes place, meaning there is a fusion of two distinct haploid gametes: a sperm cell from the father and an egg cell from the mother. Each gamete contributes half of the genetic material. This sexual reproduction process results in a unique combination of genes from both parents, creating genetic variation in the offspring. Clones, by definition, are genetically identical to a single parent and arise from asexual reproduction, which is not the case in IVF."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 5.1, shows that after fertilization and incubation, the embryos are implanted into the woman's uterus (Step 5). The uterus is the specialized organ for gestation in mammals. The question asks why this implantation into the uterus is necessary during IVF.Briefly explain why the embryo has to be implanted into the uterus during IVF.","The embryo must be implanted into the uterus during IVF because the uterus provides the essential environment and support required for its continued development and growth into a fetus. Within the uterus, the embryo will implant into the uterine lining, which is crucial for the formation of the placenta. The placenta is a vital organ that facilitates the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and waste products between the mother and the developing embryo. Furthermore, the uterus supports the formation of the amnion and amniotic sac, which allow the embryo to develop freely in a fluid-filled environment, cushioning it and protecting it from physical injuries throughout gestation."
"The provided food chain illustrates the amount of biomass transferred between trophic levels, eventually reaching humans. The chain is as follows: 1000 g of plant plankton (first trophic level) → 500 g of animal plankton (second trophic level) → 40 g of mackerel (third trophic level) → 5 g of human (fourth trophic level). This represents a decrease in biomass at each successive trophic level.Draw and label a pyramid of biomass for the food chain above.","A pyramid of biomass should be drawn with four distinct horizontal layers, stacked one above the other. The base of the pyramid, representing the first trophic level, should be the widest. Each subsequent layer upwards should be progressively narrower, visually representing the decrease in biomass at higher trophic levels. The layers should be labeled as follows, from bottom to top: Plant plankton (1000 g), Animal plankton (500 g), Mackerel (40 g), and Human (5 g)."
"The food chain is defined as: plant plankton (first trophic level) → animal plankton (second trophic level) → mackerel (third trophic level) → human (fourth trophic level). The biomass values are 1000 g, 500 g, 40 g, and 5 g respectively. The question considers a scenario where the population of the animal plankton, which is in the second trophic level, decreases.If the population in the second trophic level of the food chain is decreased, what effects on the populations of the other trophic levels may result?","If the population in the second trophic level (animal plankton) decreases, it will have cascading effects on the other trophic levels. Firstly, the population of the first trophic level (plant plankton), which serves as the food source for the animal plankton, would likely increase due to reduced predation pressure. Secondly, the population of the third trophic level (mackerel), which preys on the animal plankton, would likely decrease due to a significant reduction in their primary food supply. This could, in turn, affect the human population, as mackerel is a food source for humans."
"The food chain is defined as: plant plankton → animal plankton → mackerel → human. Plant plankton forms the base of this aquatic food chain. The scenario describes mercury being released into the water body where the plant plankton lives, and the question asks about its harmful effects on humans within this food chain.Mercury was accidentally released from a nearby factory into a water body where the plant plankton lives. Suggest how this might be harmful to human beings as part of the food chain above.","When mercury is released into the water body, the plant plankton will absorb and accumulate it in their tissues, a process known as bioaccumulation. As animal plankton consume large quantities of plant plankton, the mercury is transferred to them. Since mercury is not easily metabolized or excreted from organisms, its concentration increases at each successive trophic level in the food chain, a phenomenon called biomagnification. Consequently, mackerel, being tertiary consumers, will accumulate even higher concentrations of mercury by consuming large amounts of contaminated animal plankton. Finally, when human beings consume mackerel, they will ingest a significantly magnified concentration of mercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning, causing severe neurological damage, developmental problems, and other health issues."
"The family tree, labeled Fig. 7.1, shows the blood group phenotypes of individuals. In Generation I, Individual 1 has blood group B and Individual 2 has blood group A. In Generation II, there are six individuals: Individual 3 (A), Individual 4 (B), Individual 5 (AB), Individual 6 (A), Individual 7 (B), and Individual 8 (A). Assuming that blood groups A and B are dominant over O, and A and B are co-dominant, and given that individuals in Generation II have A, B, and AB blood types, it implies that the parents in Generation I must have been heterozygous for the O allele (i.e., Individual 1 with genotype I^B I^O and Individual 2 with genotype I^A I^O).State the number of heterozygous individuals in Generation II.","Given the parental genotypes in Generation I (Individual 1: I^B I^O and Individual 2: I^A I^O), the possible offspring genotypes are I^A I^B (Blood Group AB), I^A I^O (Blood Group A), I^B I^O (Blood Group B), and I^O I^O (Blood Group O). All the individuals in Generation II are shown to have blood types A, B, or AB: Individual 3 (A), Individual 4 (B), Individual 5 (AB), Individual 6 (A), Individual 7 (B), and Individual 8 (A). 

*   An individual with Blood Group A from these parents must have genotype I^A I^O, which is heterozygous.
*   An individual with Blood Group B from these parents must have genotype I^B I^O, which is heterozygous.
*   An individual with Blood Group AB must have genotype I^A I^B, which is heterozygous.

Since all six individuals in Generation II possess one of these blood types and genotypes, all 6 individuals in Generation II are heterozygous."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 8.1, displays chromosomes from an epidermal horn cell of a female Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) captured during the prophase stage of mitosis. The diagram shows six distinct chromosome structures. Each chromosome is condensed and appears as an 'X' shape, indicating it consists of two sister chromatids joined at a centromere. The label 'X' points to the centromere region of one of the chromosomes. The chromosomes vary slightly in length, and there appear to be three pairs of homologous chromosomes, making a total of six chromosomes.State the diploid chromosome number of the female Sumatran rhinoceros.","The diploid chromosome number of the female Sumatran rhinoceros is 2n = 6. This is directly observable from Fig. 8.1, which shows six distinct, duplicated chromosomes in the cell during prophase of mitosis."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 8.1, shows chromosomes from a cell during prophase of mitosis. Each chromosome is depicted as an 'X' shape, indicating it is duplicated and composed of two sister chromatids. The label 'X' specifically points to the centromere, which is the constricted region where sister chromatids are joined.State the roles of X in mitosis.","The label 'X' represents the centromere. In mitosis, the centromere has two primary roles: Firstly, it holds the two identical sister chromatids of a duplicated chromosome together until they need to separate. Secondly, it serves as the attachment point for spindle fibers (microtubules). These spindle fibers attach to protein structures called kinetochores located at the centromere and are responsible for aligning the chromosomes at the metaphase plate and subsequently pulling the sister chromatids apart to opposite poles of the cell during anaphase, ensuring accurate segregation of genetic material."
"The diagram, labeled Fig. 8.2, presents images of two different species of temperate frogs: R. variabilis and R. imitator. R. variabilis is shown with a bright green and black spotted pattern and is explicitly stated to be toxic. R. imitator is shown with a bright yellow and black striped pattern and is explicitly stated to be non-toxic. The text also mentions that this situation is an example of Batesian mimicry, where a harmless species mimics a harmful one.Suggest why most predators would avoid preying on R. imitator.","Most predators would avoid preying on R. imitator due to Batesian mimicry. R. imitator, being a non-toxic species, has evolved to display a warning coloration and pattern (bright yellow and black stripes) that closely resembles the toxic R. variabilis. Predators that have previously encountered R. variabilis and learned to associate its distinctive bright coloration with an unpleasant or harmful experience (e.g., toxicity) will generalize this learned avoidance to R. imitator. They mistake the harmless mimic for the harmful model, thus avoiding predation on R. imitator even though it is not toxic."
"Figure 8.2 shows R. imitator, a non-toxic frog with a distinctive yellow and black striped pattern, and R. variabilis, a toxic frog with a green and black spotted pattern. This is an example of Batesian mimicry. The question asks for an explanation of R. imitator's pattern in terms of natural selection, which drives evolutionary change based on differential survival and reproduction.Suggest an explanation, in terms of natural selection, for the pattern on the body of R. imitator.","The distinct pattern on the body of R. imitator is a result of natural selection. Within the ancestral R. imitator population, there would have been natural genetic variation, with some individuals exhibiting patterns that, by chance, bore a closer resemblance to the toxic R. variabilis than others. Predators, having learned to avoid the toxic R. variabilis due to its warning coloration (aposematism), would be more likely to avoid those R. imitator individuals that closely mimicked R. variabilis. Consequently, these better-mimicking R. imitator individuals experienced a higher survival rate because they were less frequently preyed upon. These survivors were then more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes for the mimetic pattern to their offspring. Over many generations, this differential survival and reproduction, driven by predator avoidance, led to an increase in the frequency of the genes coding for the advantageous mimetic pattern, eventually resulting in the evolution of the characteristic pattern observed on the body of R. imitator today."
"The experiment involves two groups of healthy adult males (Group A and Group B) consuming different liquids (water vs. sodium chloride solution) and measuring their average urine output over time. To ensure the reliability of such an experiment, initial conditions must be standardized and potential confounding variables controlled. The graph shows average volume of urine produced over time.State one important precaution that should be carried out by these men at the start of the experiment to increase the reliability of the experiment.","One important precaution to increase the reliability of the experiment is to ensure that all men in both Group A and Group B empty their bladders completely at the very start of the experiment. This ensures that all urine subsequently collected and measured is solely the result of the ingested liquids (water or sodium chloride solution) and not residual urine present from before the experiment began, thus providing accurate and comparable baseline data."
"The graph displays two curves, Curve X and Curve Y, representing the average urine volume produced (cm³ per ½ hour) over time (hrs) for two groups of healthy adult males. Group A drank 1 dm³ of water, and Group B drank 1 dm³ of 0.96% sodium chloride solution. Curve X shows a high peak urine output of about 200 cm³ per ½ hour, while Curve Y shows a much lower peak urine output of about 50 cm³ per ½ hour. The question asks to identify which curve corresponds to drinking sodium chloride solution.Which curve represents the effects of drinking 1 dm³ of sodium chloride solution?","Curve Y represents the effects of drinking 1 dm³ of sodium chloride solution. Consuming a solution of sodium chloride will increase the solute concentration in the blood, which tends to reduce urine production as the body attempts to conserve water to maintain osmotic balance."
"Curve Y in the graph represents the effect of drinking 1 dm³ of 0.96% sodium chloride solution, showing a significantly lower urine output compared to drinking plain water (Curve X). The question asks for an explanation of this effect, specifically involving a hormone and a target excretory organ.Explain your answer, in terms of the effects of a named, appropriate hormone and the target excretory organ involved.","When 1 dm³ of 0.96% sodium chloride solution is consumed, the concentration of solutes in the blood increases, leading to a decrease in the blood's water potential. This change is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus of the brain, which then stimulates the posterior pituitary gland to secrete more Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. ADH is the appropriate hormone here. This hormone travels through the bloodstream to its primary target excretory organ, the kidneys. Specifically, ADH increases the permeability of the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys to water. This increased permeability facilitates greater reabsorption of water from the filtrate back into the bloodstream, resulting in a reduced volume of highly concentrated urine, which is reflected by Curve Y."
"The question asks for another organ, besides the kidneys, that can eliminate sodium chloride from the body. The kidneys are the primary excretory organs for maintaining salt and water balance.Name another organ through which sodium chloride could also have been eliminated.","Another organ through which sodium chloride can be eliminated from the body is the skin, via sweat glands in the process of sweating."
The question asks for a definition of excretion and an explanation of its importance. Excretion is a fundamental biological process for maintaining an organism's internal balance.Define the term excretion and explain its importance to our body.,"Excretion is the biological process by which metabolic waste products and toxic substances are eliminated from the body. It is of crucial importance to our body because the accumulation of these substances would be highly detrimental. If metabolic wastes, such as urea, carbon dioxide, and excess salts, or ingested toxins were to remain in the body, they would disrupt the internal environment (homeostasis) by upsetting the water potential, pH, and chemical balance of the blood and interstitial fluids. Such imbalances can impair the normal functioning of cells, damage blood cells, prevent enzymes from working at their optimum conditions, and interfere with essential physiological processes. A high concentration of toxic substances can ultimately lead to cell damage, organ failure, and can even be fatal."
"The question asks for a description of the structure of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA), the genetic material found in living organisms. No visual is provided, so the description must rely on general biological knowledge.Describe the structure of DNA.","DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is a double-helical molecule, often described as a twisted ladder. It is a polymer made up of repeating monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), or Thymine (T). The two polynucleotide strands of DNA are antiparallel (run in opposite directions) and are held together by hydrogen bonds formed between complementary base pairs. Adenine always pairs with Thymine (A-T) via two hydrogen bonds, and Guanine always pairs with Cytosine (G-C) via three hydrogen bonds. These base pairs form the 'rungs' of the ladder, while the alternating sugar-phosphate groups form the two 'sides' or 'backbones' of the ladder. The specific sequence of these nitrogenous bases along the DNA molecule constitutes the genetic code, which is organized into functional units called genes, carrying all the hereditary information."
"The question asks to outline the process of mass-producing human insulin using bacteria, a common application of medical biotechnology and genetic engineering. This process involves manipulating genetic material to introduce human genes into bacterial cells.Outline how human insulin can be mass-produced using bacteria in medical biotechnology.","The mass production of human insulin using bacteria in medical biotechnology involves several key steps in genetic engineering. First, the specific human gene that codes for insulin is identified and isolated from human DNA using restriction endonuclease enzymes. Simultaneously, a small, circular piece of DNA called a plasmid is extracted from a bacterium, typically E. coli, and cut open using the same restriction enzyme. This ensures that both the human insulin gene and the opened plasmid have complementary 'sticky ends'. The isolated human insulin gene is then inserted into the opened bacterial plasmid, and an enzyme called DNA ligase is used to join the sticky ends, forming a recombinant plasmid. This recombinant plasmid is then introduced into bacterial cells through a process called transformation, often facilitated by heat shock or electroporation to make the bacterial cell membranes permeable. The transformed bacteria, now containing the recombinant plasmid with the human insulin gene, are cultured in large quantities in bioreactors. As these transgenic bacteria multiply, they express the human insulin gene, synthesizing large amounts of human insulin protein, which can then be harvested and purified for therapeutic use in diabetic patients."
"The question asks to describe the cycling of carbon, specifically focusing on a glucose molecule within an animal's body and its broader role in an ecosystem. Carbon is a key element that cycles through various reservoirs and forms in the environment.Describe how the carbon in a glucose molecule in the body of an animal is cycled in an ecosystem.","The carbon in a glucose molecule within an animal's body is intricately cycled within an ecosystem. An animal typically obtains glucose by consuming plants (producers) or other animals (consumers) that originally synthesized glucose through photosynthesis. Once ingested, this glucose is primarily used as a respiratory substrate. During cellular respiration, the animal oxidizes the glucose molecule to release energy for its metabolic activities. As a by-product of this process, the carbon atoms from glucose are converted into carbon dioxide (CO₂), which the animal then exhales into the atmosphere. This atmospheric CO₂ is subsequently absorbed by green plants (producers) for photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants utilize the carbon atoms from CO₂ to synthesize new glucose molecules and other organic compounds, effectively returning the carbon to the organic matter reservoir of the ecosystem. Additionally, some of the glucose in the animal's body may be converted into other organic molecules like proteins or fats, which become part of the animal's biomass. If another animal consumes this animal, the carbon in these molecules is transferred to the new consumer. Upon the animal's death, decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break down its organic matter, releasing the carbon back into the soil and atmosphere as CO₂ through their own respiration, thus completing the carbon cycle."
"The question asks for a description of the movement of essential materials within a plant, specifically referencing the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) in roots, stems, and leaves. Plants rely on these specialized transport systems to distribute water, minerals, and organic nutrients throughout their structure.With reference to the vascular tissues in roots, stems and leaves, describe the movement of essential materials within a plant.","Within a plant, essential materials move through two specialized vascular tissues: xylem and phloem, found in the roots, stems, and leaves.

1.  **Movement of Water and Mineral Salts (Xylem):** Water and dissolved mineral salts (e.g., nitrates) are absorbed by the root hairs in the roots. These materials are then transported upwards through the xylem vessels, which form a continuous network from the roots, through the stem, and into the leaves. The primary driving force for this upward movement is transpiration pull. Water evaporates from the leaves through stomata, creating a negative pressure (tension) that pulls the continuous column of water molecules (due to cohesion and adhesion) up the xylem. This ensures that water and minerals reach all photosynthetic tissues in the leaves and other parts of the plant.

2.  **Movement of Organic Nutrients (Phloem):** Organic nutrients, primarily sucrose (synthesized from glucose during photosynthesis in the leaves) and amino acids, are transported through the phloem tissue. This process is called translocation. Phloem consists mainly of sieve tube cells and companion cells. Sucrose and amino acids are actively loaded from 'source' regions (e.g., leaves where photosynthesis occurs) into the sieve tube cells, often with the help of companion cells providing energy (ATP). This increases the solute concentration in the sieve tube, causing water to move in by osmosis from adjacent xylem, building up turgor pressure. This pressure drives the phloem sap through the sieve tubes from the source to 'sink' regions (e.g., roots for storage, developing fruits, growing tips) where these nutrients are unloaded and utilized or stored. Phloem transport is bidirectional, allowing nutrients to be delivered wherever they are needed."
"The text states that food poisoning can be caused by bacteria, such as Campylobacter. Erythromycin, an antibiotic, reduces Campylobacter counts in people with infections. Figure 1.1 is a line graph showing the concentration of Campylobacter protein over time after erythromycin intake. The y-axis is ""Concentration of Campylobacter protein / 100 cells per ml"", ranging from 0 to 9. The x-axis is ""Duration after erythromycin intake / h"", ranging from 0 to 6 hours. The line starts at 0 concentration at 0 hours. It rises to approximately 7.5 at 1 hour, then gradually decreases, reaching about 6.5 at 2 hours, 4.2 at 3 hours, and 2.2 at 4 hours. From 4 hours, it increases again to approximately 4.5 at 5 hours.Describe and explain the results in Fig. 1.1, from 2 h to 4 h after erythromycin intake.","From 2 hours to 4 hours after erythromycin intake, the concentration of Campylobacter protein decreased from approximately 800 cells per ml (8 on the y-axis) at 2 hours to about 220 cells per ml (2.2 on the y-axis) at 4 hours, representing a decrease of approximately 580 cells per ml. More specifically, from 2 to 3 hours, the concentration dropped steeply from 800 cells per ml to about 420 cells per ml (4.2 on y-axis), a decrease of about 380 cells per ml. From 3 to 4 hours, the decrease was less steep, from 420 cells per ml to 220 cells per ml, a decrease of about 200 cells per ml. This decrease is explained by erythromycin, an antibiotic, inhibiting bacteria growth and metabolic activities, such as cell wall synthesis, cell membrane function, protein synthesis in ribosomes, or enzyme action in the cytoplasm. The 2-4 hour period for the effect to show can be attributed to the time needed for the antibiotic's digestion, absorption, and transport to the site of infection."
"Figure 1.2 shows a diagram of a Campylobacter bacterium. It is depicted as an elongated oval shape with an outer boundary and an inner boundary. Inside, there are small dots representing ribosomes and a larger circular structure representing circular DNA. A flagellum, a whip-like appendage, extends from one end of the bacterium.Identify two structures in the Campylobacter bacterium shown in Fig. 1.2 that are absent in a typical virus.","Two structures present in the Campylobacter bacterium shown in Figure 1.2 that are absent in a typical virus are the cell wall and the (free) ribosomes. Viruses typically lack a cell wall and the cellular machinery like ribosomes for protein synthesis, instead relying on host cells for replication."
Campylobacteriosis is an illness caused by the Campylobacter bacteria. Vaccination against Campylobacter has been found to reduce intestinal disease and prevent stunted growth in infants. The vaccine is produced by culturing and inactivating Campylobacter strains and removing toxins to create a 'whole-cell' vaccine.Suggest and explain whether Campylobacter infections are infectious.,"Yes, Campylobacter infections are infectious. This is because infectious diseases can be spread from person to person, and Campylobacter is known to spread through contaminated food or other routes."
Campylobacteriosis is an illness caused by the Campylobacter bacteria. Vaccination against Campylobacter has been found to reduce intestinal disease and prevent stunted growth in infants. The vaccine is produced by culturing and inactivating Campylobacter strains and removing toxins to create a 'whole-cell' vaccine.Suggest how the vaccine prevents Campylobacter infection in an individual.,"The vaccine prevents Campylobacter infection by introducing an inactivated form of Campylobacter (a 'whole-cell' vaccine) or its antigens into the body. This stimulates the white blood cells to bind to the antigens on the vaccine, initiating an immune response. After this initial exposure, some white blood cells develop into memory cells that remain in the bloodstream for a long time. If the individual is exposed to actual Campylobacter in the future, these memory cells will rapidly recognize the pathogen and produce specific antibodies to destroy it, thus preventing infection or reducing its severity."
"The text describes cacti as desert plants adapted to water-scarce environments. Figure 2.1 shows a visual representation of a potted cactus plant, which is characterized by its leaves being modified into sharp spines.Suggest how the leaves in a cactus plant shown in Fig. 2.1 prevents wilting in water scarce environments.","The leaves of a cactus are modified into spines, as shown in Figure 2.1. This modification significantly reduces the surface area-to-volume ratio of the leaves. A smaller surface area exposed to the environment means less water loss through transpiration. By minimizing water loss through transpiration, the cactus plant can conserve its water supply, thereby preventing wilting in water-scarce desert environments where the rate of water loss often exceeds the rate of water gained from the roots."
"Figure 2.2 presents a diagram illustrating the cross-section of a cactus plant stem or root. The diagram shows a central vascular cylinder surrounded by various plant tissues. Within the central vascular cylinder, there is an inner region composed of larger, lignified vessels and an outer region containing smaller, non-lignified vessels.Use label lines and labels to identify the position of the xylem and phloem in Fig. 2.2 below.","In Figure 2.2, the xylem, which consists of lignified vessels for water transport, would be located in the inner region of the central vascular bundle. The phloem, composed of non-lignified vessels responsible for transporting sugars, would be positioned in the outer region of the central vascular bundle, surrounding the xylem."
"Figure 2.3 illustrates a mangrove tree growing in a coastal swamp, where the soil is constantly filled with water. The mangrove tree has specially modified roots that erect out of the ground. The diagram shows arrows M, N, and P representing the movement of gases into and out of the tree during the day. Gas M is specifically indicated to move only out of the tree during the daytime.Name gas M and gas P in Fig. 2.3. For each gas state the chemical process in the tree which produces it.","Gas M is Oxygen, which is produced by the chemical process of photosynthesis. Gas P is Carbon Dioxide, which is produced by the chemical process of respiration."
The text describes that mangrove roots are specially modified to erect out of the ground because the air spaces in the soil are always filled with water. Active transport is mentioned as a process that occurs in most plant roots.Suggest why mangrove roots may have difficulty in carrying out this process.,"Mangrove roots may have difficulty carrying out active transport because active transport requires energy, which is produced through aerobic respiration. However, mangrove roots are often submerged in waterlogged soil where there is a low concentration of dissolved oxygen. This lack of oxygen limits aerobic respiration, thus reducing the energy supply necessary for active transport to occur efficiently."
"Figure 3.1 illustrates a heart with major blood vessels. It shows a bypass procedure where an artificial blood vessel is used to circumvent a blocked blood vessel. This artificial vessel is fixed into a larger vessel labeled 'vessel A', which originates from the top of the heart. The 'blocked blood vessel' is a branch located on the surface of the heart, seemingly supplying the heart muscle itself.Name the blocked blood vessel and vessel A respectively.",The blocked blood vessel is the Coronary artery. Vessel A is the Aorta.
"Figure 3.1 depicts a blocked blood vessel, identified as a coronary artery, on the surface of the heart, which is being bypassed by an artificial blood vessel. Coronary arteries are responsible for supplying blood to the heart muscle itself.Describe how the blocked blood vessel in Fig. 3.1 can affect the normal functioning of the heart.","A blocked coronary artery, as depicted in Figure 3.1, means that the heart muscles will receive less oxygen and glucose. This reduced supply of essential nutrients and oxygen will lead to a decreased rate of aerobic respiration in the heart muscle cells. Consequently, these heart muscle cells will be deprived of sufficient energy and may die, which can result in a heart attack and impair the normal pumping function of the heart."
"The context describes a bypass procedure where a blocked blood vessel is circumvented. It mentions that sometimes, instead of an artificial blood vessel, a vein from another part of the patient's body is used for this purpose.Suggest two ways in which a vein might not be suitable for this purpose.","Two ways in which a vein might not be suitable for bypassing a blocked artery are: 1. Veins have thinner muscular walls and less elastic tissue compared to arteries. This makes them less able to withstand the high blood pressure present in arteries, potentially leading to rupture or aneurysm. 2. Veins contain valves to prevent the backflow of blood, which would impede the unidirectional flow of blood under arterial pressure if used as an arterial bypass. The presence of these valves would slow down or impede blood flow, making the bypass inefficient."
"Figure 3.2 illustrates two states of a blood vessel. The first diagram shows a 'blood vessel with blockage B', where a narrowing in the vessel is caused by material labeled 'B'. The second diagram, titled 'same blood vessel with 'stent' in place', shows the same vessel where a 'stent' (a small tube made of stainless steel mesh) has been inserted to keep the vessel open at the site of the original blockage B.Name a substance that can cause the blockage B.",The substance that can cause the blockage B is a fat deposit or cholesterol.
The context describes that inserting a 'stent' (a small tube of stainless steel mesh) to clear blockage B in a blood vessel can cause damage to the surrounding tissues. Blockage B was identified as a fat deposit or cholesterol.Suggest and explain why patients are given 'anti-platelet' drugs before inserting the 'stent'.,"Patients are given 'anti-platelet' drugs before stent insertion to prevent the formation of blood clots. The insertion of a stent can cause damage to the surrounding blood vessel tissues, which triggers the release of platelets. These platelets can then aggregate and lead to the formation of blood clots, potentially narrowing the blood vessel again or causing a complete blockage. Anti-platelet drugs work by preventing platelet activation and aggregation, thereby reducing the risk of clot formation and ensuring the stent remains open and functional."
"Kelp are described as large underwater plants that provide food and shelter. Figure 4.1 outlines a food chain: kelp are consumed by marine invertebrates, marine invertebrates are consumed by small fish, small fish are consumed by large fish, and large fish are consumed by tawny owls.Sketch a pyramid of numbers for the food chain in Fig. 4.1.","A pyramid of numbers represents the number of individual organisms at each trophic level. For the given food chain: Tawny owl (top, fewest individuals), Large fish (next level down, more individuals than owls), Small fish (next level down, more individuals than large fish), Marine invertebrates (next level down, more individuals than small fish), Kelp (bottom, largest number of individuals, forming the base of the pyramid). The pyramid would typically be upright, with the number of organisms decreasing as one moves up the trophic levels from kelp to tawny owl."
"Tawny owls in southern Finland exhibit two inherited feather colors: brown and light grey. Both types are preyed upon by larger carnivorous birds. Figure 4.2 is a line graph depicting the percentage of each tawny owl type in the population relative to winter snow depth. The y-axis shows the 'percentage of each type of tawny owl in the tawny owl population / %' ranging from 0 to 100. The x-axis shows 'winter snow depth / cm' ranging from 0 to 20 cm. The solid line, representing 'brown tawny owl', shows a decrease in percentage from approximately 55% at 0 cm snow depth to about 28% at 20 cm snow depth. Conversely, the dashed line, representing 'light grey tawny owl', shows an increase in percentage from approximately 45% at 0 cm snow depth to about 72% at 20 cm snow depth.Explain how natural selection brings about the change in the percentage of the tawny owls with light grey feathers as the winter snow depth increases.","As winter snow depth increases, the percentage of light grey tawny owls in the population increases, while that of brown tawny owls decreases, as shown in Figure 4.2. This change is due to natural selection. Light grey owls are better camouflaged against a snowy background compared to brown tawny owls. Therefore, in environments with deeper snow, light grey owls have a selective advantage as they are less easily spotted and preyed upon by larger carnivorous birds. Consequently, fewer light grey owls are eaten, allowing more of them to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes for light grey feathers to their offspring. Over generations, this leads to an increased proportion of light grey tawny owls in the population as snow depth increases."
"The previous context indicates that the percentage of light grey tawny owls increases with greater winter snow depth, implying snow is a significant environmental factor.Describe how human activity can lead to a decrease in winter snow depth.","Human activity can lead to a decrease in winter snow depth primarily through contributions to climate change. This includes: 1. Combustion of fossil fuels: Burning coal, oil, and natural gas for energy releases large quantities of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. 2. Deforestation: The clearing of forests reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, further contributing to its accumulation in the atmosphere. These activities enhance the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming, which results in higher average temperatures. Higher temperatures cause less precipitation to fall as snow and accelerate snowmelt, thus decreasing overall winter snow depth."
"No specific context is provided, this question asks about a biological process related to physical activity.Describe how physical activity can lead to oxygen debt and how oxygen debt can be paid.","During vigorous physical activity, muscles contract intensely, demanding a rapid supply of energy. When oxygen supply to the muscle cells cannot meet this high demand, muscle cells begin to carry out anaerobic respiration in addition to aerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration produces lactic acid, which accumulates in the muscles, leading to muscle soreness and fatigue. The amount of oxygen needed to break down this accumulated lactic acid is known as the oxygen debt. To repay the oxygen debt, the body maintains a high heart rate and a deep, fast breathing rate even after exercise stops. This ensures a continuous and fast uptake of oxygen from the lungs and its rapid transport to the muscles and the liver. In the liver, the absorbed oxygen is used to oxidize the lactic acid, converting it back into pyruvate, which can then be completely broken down through aerobic respiration, or converted into glucose. Once all the accumulated lactic acid has been processed, the oxygen debt is repaid, and the body returns to its resting state."
"Electronic cigarettes simulate tobacco smoking and contain liquids with chemicals like nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerol, and flavorings. Propylene glycol can cause skin irritations and inflammation. Exposure to fumes from the vaporized liquids is stated to potentially lead to cancer.Electronic cigarettes are just as harmful as traditional tobacco smoke. Based on the given information, explain why this is so.","Based on the given information, electronic cigarettes can be considered just as harmful as traditional tobacco smoke for several reasons: 1. Nicotine Content: Electronic cigarette liquids contain nicotine, which is also present in traditional tobacco smoke. Nicotine is an addictive drug that releases adrenaline, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure. It can also cause blood clots and narrow artery lumens, increasing the risk of coronary diseases and affecting fetal development. 2. Carcinogenic Effects: The text states that exposure to fumes from the vaporisation of e-liquids may lead to cancer, similar to the known carcinogenic effects of traditional tobacco smoke (due to substances like tar). This indicates that both forms of smoking carry a risk of cancer. 3. Inflammation: Propylene glycol, a component in e-liquids, can cause irritations and inflammation when in contact with the skin. Inhaling these fumes can cause inflammation in the respiratory system, similar to how irritants and tar in traditional tobacco smoke cause inflammation and can paralyze cilia lining the air passages, leading to a build-up of mucus and further inflammation."
"The investigation involved five groups of Type 1 diabetes patients treated with different drugs or combinations: Tzield, Drug A, Drug B, Tzield + A, and Tzield + B. Table 6.1 shows the mean blood glucose concentrations 30 minutes after a meal as: Tzield (277 mg/100 cm³), A (282 mg/100 cm³), B (271 mg/100 cm³), Tzield + A (305 mg/100 cm³), and Tzield + B (306 mg/100 cm³). The number of people involved in each group varied: 60 for Tzield, 40 for A, 25 for B, 65 for Tzield + A, and 30 for Tzield + B. A student claimed that 'Tzield works better when used with other drugs.'Do you agree or disagree with the student's statement. Use the given information to support your answer.","I disagree with the student's statement that 'Tzield works better when used with other drugs.' Based on the data in Table 6.1, Tzield alone resulted in a mean blood glucose concentration of 277 mg/100 cm³ 30 minutes after the meal. However, when Tzield was combined with other drugs, the mean blood glucose concentrations were higher: Tzield + A resulted in 305 mg/100 cm³, and Tzield + B resulted in 306 mg/100 cm³. A lower blood glucose concentration indicates better control. Therefore, the combinations of Tzield with other drugs (A or B) actually led to higher blood glucose levels compared to Tzield used alone, suggesting that Tzield alone was more effective in reducing blood glucose concentration in this study. Additionally, the reliability of the conclusion could be questioned because the number of people in each group is different (e.g., 60 for Tzield, 25 for B), and the total sample size of 220 people might not be very large for such a study, which could affect the statistical significance of the results."

"Dilating eye drops are described as drugs used to relax certain muscles in the eyes, which leads to pupil dilation, typically administered before an eye examination.Name the muscle that the dilating eye drops act on.",The dilating eye drops act on the circular and radial muscles of the iris.
"Figure 7.1 displays a diagram of a human eye, showing the iris and a central pupil. Next to this eye, a larger empty circle is provided to indicate how a pupil would appear after dilation. Dilating eye drops relax muscles in the iris to dilate the pupil.With clear labels, complete Fig. 7.1 to show how a pupil will appear after dilation.","After dilation, the pupil, represented by the larger circle in Figure 7.1, would appear significantly larger in diameter. This occurs because the radial muscles of the iris would contract, pulling the pupil open, while the circular muscles of the iris would relax, allowing the pupil to expand."
"The context states that dilation drops can cause the paralysis of other muscles in the eye, beyond just those responsible for pupil dilation.Predict how the paralysis of the ciliary muscle might affect the patient's vision.","Paralysis of the ciliary muscle would severely affect a patient's ability to focus on objects at different distances, particularly near objects. The ciliary muscles are responsible for controlling the curvature or thickness of the eye lens. When these muscles are paralyzed, they cannot contract, which means the suspensory ligaments attached to the lens cannot slacken. As a result, the lens would remain thin and less convex, unable to become thicker or more convex. This configuration is suitable for distant vision, as the lens's focal length remains long and cannot decrease. Therefore, the patient would experience blurred or unfocused vision when trying to look at near objects, a condition known as cycloplegia."
"Rhabdostyla is a single-celled organism, lacking a cell wall and chlorophyll, that inhabits freshwater environments like ponds and rivers. Freshwater is characterized by a very low solute concentration. Figure 8.1 illustrates the function of Rhabdostyla's contractile vacuole, which periodically fills with water and then expels it, indicating its role in removing excess water.Suggest a reason why Rhabdostyla needs to remove excess water.","Rhabdostyla needs to remove excess water because it lives in freshwater, which has a significantly higher water potential (lower solute concentration) than the cytoplasm of the Rhabdostyla cell. Due to this water potential gradient, water molecules will continuously move by osmosis from the surrounding freshwater into the cell. Since Rhabdostyla is a single-celled organism without a cell wall, the continuous influx of water would cause the cell to swell and eventually burst. The contractile vacuole, therefore, acts as an osmoregulatory organelle to actively pump out this excess water, preventing lysis."
"Rhabdostyla, a single-celled organism without a cell wall, lives in freshwater and uses a contractile vacuole to fill with and expel excess water at intervals.Explain whether osmosis is involved in expelling water out of the cell from the contractile vacuole.","No, osmosis is not directly involved in expelling water out of the cell from the contractile vacuole. Osmosis is the passive movement of water across a partially permeable membrane down a water potential gradient. The expulsion of water from the contractile vacuole, as depicted in Figure 8.1, is an active process where the vacuole contracts to forcibly eject water from the cell. While osmosis is responsible for the water entering the cell from the freshwater environment, the subsequent removal of water by the contractile vacuole is an active process, not osmosis."
"An experiment investigated the rate of water excretion by Rhabdostyla's contractile vacuole when organisms were placed in different concentrations of seawater. Figure 8.2 is a bar chart showing the results. The y-axis represents the 'rate of water excreted / cm³ s⁻¹' (ranging from 0 to 20), and the x-axis represents the 'concentration of sea water / %' (with data points at 0%, 4%, and 12%). The bar for 0% seawater shows an excretion rate of 17.2 cm³ s⁻¹. For 4% seawater, the rate is 10.4 cm³ s⁻¹. For 12% seawater, the rate is 0.4 cm³ s⁻¹.Describe and explain the results shown in Fig. 8.2.","Figure 8.2 shows that as the concentration of sea water increases, the rate of water excreted by the Rhabdostyla's contractile vacuole significantly decreases. At 0% sea water (freshwater), the highest excretion rate is observed at 17.2 cm³ s⁻¹. When the sea water concentration increases to 4%, the excretion rate drops to 10.4 cm³ s⁻¹, a decrease of 6.8 cm³ s⁻¹. Further increasing the sea water concentration to 12% causes the excretion rate to fall drastically to 0.4 cm³ s⁻¹, a decrease of 10.0 cm³ s⁻¹ from the 4% concentration. This trend is explained by the principle of osmosis. As the external concentration of sea water increases, the water potential gradient between the Rhabdostyla's cytoplasm and its surrounding environment becomes less steep (or even reverses at very high concentrations). This means that less water enters the cell from the external environment by osmosis. Consequently, the Rhabdostyla needs to excrete less excess water, leading to a reduced rate of contractile vacuole activity."
No specific context is provided for this definition question.Define the term sexual reproduction.,Sexual reproduction is a biological process that involves the fusion of a male gamete's haploid nucleus with a female gamete's haploid nucleus to form a diploid zygote. This process typically leads to the production of genetically dissimilar offspring.
The previous context describes the stages of the menstrual cycle and defines the fertile period based on ovulation occurring on 15 May.Explain why another healthy woman may not have the same fertile period as the woman in (b).,"Another healthy woman may not have the same fertile period as the woman in (b) because there is natural variation in the length of menstrual cycles among different individuals. While a 28-day cycle is considered average, some women have shorter or longer cycles, or cycles that vary in length from month to month. This variation means that the timing of ovulation, and consequently the fertile window, will differ between women."
"Figure 1 displays two types of tissues, an animal tissue (Tissue A) and a plant tissue (Tissue B), adapted for their functions. Tissue A, an animal tissue, appears as a cross-section resembling the wall of an intestine, featuring numerous finger-like projections called villi. Structure 1 points to one of these individual villi, which has an actual height of 1.6 mm, as indicated by a scale bar. Structure 2 points to the epithelial cells that line the surface of structure 1 (the villus). Tissue B, a plant tissue, appears as a branched, tubular structure, typical of plant vascular tissue, potentially for transport.

"Figure 4.1 illustrates a simplified mammalian circulatory system, showing the heart in the center, acting as a pump. Blood leaves the heart via the pulmonary artery, traveling to the 'capillaries in lungs', then returns to the heart via the pulmonary vein. Simultaneously, blood leaves the heart through the aorta, which branches into 'arteries to head' and 'arteries to body', leading to 'capillaries in organs'. From these capillaries and other 'veins to heart', blood returns to the heart. The diagram depicts two distinct circulatory loops: one between the heart and the lungs (pulmonary circulation), and another between the heart and the rest of the body (systemic circulation).Describe and explain how a molecule of oxygen is forced out of the heart and eventually reaches the liver cells.","When the muscles in the wall of the left ventricle of the heart contract during ventricular systole, the pressure inside the left ventricle increases, becoming higher than that in the aorta. This forces the aortic valve to open, and oxygenated blood, in which oxygen molecules are bound to haemoglobin in red blood cells (forming oxyhaemoglobin), is pumped into the aorta. From the aorta, this blood flows through arteries to the body, specifically via the hepatic artery to the liver. Once in the liver capillaries, the oxygen diffuses out of the red blood cells, then out of the plasma, into the tissue fluid, and finally into the liver cells."

The capillary wall appears to have openings through which fluid can pass out into the surrounding tissue.State two differences between the composition of tissue fluid and blood.","1. Blood contains red blood cells and various white blood cells (e.g., lymphocytes), whereas tissue fluid typically lacks red blood cells and contains only a small number of phagocytes. 2. Blood contains a high concentration of large plasma proteins, while tissue fluid contains very few or no large plasma proteins."

This results in a significantly decreased total surface area available for gaseous exchange. Additionally, the lungs lose their elasticity and become permanently inflated with air. These changes mean that the person will suffer from symptoms like wheezing, breathlessness, and difficulty breathing, as the lungs become less efficient at exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and expelling air."

"Figure 6.2 outlines the procedure of dialysis for patients with kidney failure. The process is broken down into four stages: Stage 1: 'blood from body enters dialysis machine'. Stage 2: 'blood flow in the machine regulated by a pump and anticoagulant added'. Stage 3: 'blood is bathed in dialysis fluid (dialysate)'. Stage 4: ''cleaned' blood returns to body from dialysis machine'. Figure 6.3 provides further details on how Stage 3 of the dialysis procedure (blood bathed in dialysate) is achieved. The diagram shows a tubular 'membrane' through which blood flows, indicated by 'direction of blood flow inside membrane' from left to right. This membrane is surrounded by a chamber where 'dialysate in' flows from the top right, entering the chamber, and 'dialysate out' flows from the bottom left, exiting the chamber. The dialysate flows in the opposite direction to the blood.Explain how the dialysis machine ensures that 'cleaned' blood returns to the body.","The dialysis machine ensures 'cleaned' blood returns to the body through several mechanisms: 1. The dialysate fluid does not contain metabolic waste products like urea, creating a steep concentration gradient for these wastes to diffuse from the blood into the dialysate. 2. Blood and dialysate flow in opposite directions (countercurrent flow) across a partially-permeable membrane, maintaining a continuous concentration gradient for efficient diffusion. 3. The tubing is long and coiled, providing a large surface area for diffusion. The membrane allows small waste molecules to diffuse out while retaining large molecules (like proteins and blood cells) in the blood. Thus, waste products are removed, and essential substances are kept, returning 'cleaned' blood to the body."
"The provided text describes an investigation into wind pollination in maize and how the duration of maize pollen's exposure to air affects its ability to fertilize female flowers. The procedure involved: 1. Removing pollen grains from maize flowers and exposing them to the air for different durations. 2. Subsequently placing these pollen grains onto groups of female maize flowers located in a separate plot of land. 3. Observing that the fertilized flowers developed into 'ears', and then counting the number of seeds produced per ear.Explain why the type of pollination stated in (i) is more beneficial to maize.","Cross-pollination is more beneficial to maize because it introduces genetic variation into the offspring. By combining genetic material from two different parent plants, more varieties of offspring can be produced. This increased genetic diversity enhances the species' ability to adapt and survive in changing environmental conditions, as some offspring may possess beneficial qualities from both parents that make them better suited to new challenges."

They would start by identifying individual teosinte plants that exhibit desirable traits, such as softer kernels, a larger number of kernels, or larger fruit size. These selected plants would then be cross-pollinated or hybridized. The seeds from these crosses would be planted, and the resulting offspring would again be screened for the desired traits. This process of selecting offspring with improved characteristics and repeatedly breeding them over many generations would gradually accumulate the genetic changes leading to the domesticated form of maize with its characteristic large, soft ears."

This change in DNA sequence leads to a different mRNA sequence during transcription. Consequently, during translation, a different amino acid would be incorporated into the polypeptide chain at that specific position, or it could even lead to a premature stop codon depending on the specific change. This altered amino acid sequence would result in a different protein structure, which could significantly affect the protein's function. This altered protein (e.g., an enzyme or structural protein) could then lead to large differences in the physical characteristics, or phenotype, such as kernel hardness, number, and overall fruit size, observed between teosinte and maize."

Secondly, meiosis introduces genetic variation into the egg cells due to crossing over and independent assortment, which contributes to the genetic diversity of the offspring."
"An investigation into feeding relationships in a forest community using radioactively labeled phosphorus (32P) is described. 32P phosphate ions were supplied to plants using stem wells. Figure 9.1 shows a vertical cross-section of a stem well. A 'plant stem' is inserted into the well, which contains a 'solution containing 32P labelled phosphate'. The top of the well is covered with a 'cover'. In the experiment, 200 such stem wells were used to supply 32P to plants for one week, after which the wells were removed. Tissue samples were taken from the plants and other community members at various intervals, and the activity of 32P phosphate ions per unit biomass was measured. Graph 9.2 presents the results, plotting 'activity of 32P phosphate ions per unit biomass / arbitrary units' on the y-axis against 'time/weeks' on the x-axis, from 0 to 12 weeks. The period when 'wells were attached' is indicated from week 0 to week 1. The graph displays four curves: 1. 'Treated plants': Shows a sharp increase in 32P activity during week 1, peaking at the end of week 1, then a steady decline over subsequent weeks. 2. 'Species X - a primary consumer': Shows 32P activity starting at 0, rising sharply after week 0, reaching a peak around week 2-3, and then declining to 0 by week 4-5. 3. 'Other primary consumers': Shows 32P activity starting at 0, rising slowly and gradually, reaching a peak much later, around week 6-8, and then declining slowly. 4. 'Secondary consumers': Shows 32P activity starting at 0, rising very slowly, reaching a peak very late, around week 10-12, and then declining very slowly.With reference to Graph 9.2, describe and explain the level of activity of 32P phosphate ions observed in the four populations of organisms.","Referring to Graph 9.2: 
1. **Treated plants**: The 32P activity in treated plants increases sharply during week 1, peaking at the end of week 1. This is because the plants directly absorb the 32P phosphate ions from the stem wells and incorporate them into organic molecules like amino acids and proteins. After week 1, the activity gradually decreases as the plants metabolize the 32P, use it for growth, and new growth no longer contains the label, effectively diluting the concentration. 
2. **Species X - a primary consumer**: The 32P activity in Species X starts at 0, then rises sharply after week 0, peaking around week 2-3, and declining to 0 by week 4-5. This indicates that Species X is a primary consumer that feeds directly and primarily on the treated plants. The increase in 32P is due to its consumption of labeled plants. Its peak is earlier and higher than other primary consumers, suggesting its reliance on the treated plants. The subsequent decline is due to metabolism, excretion, and potentially being consumed by secondary consumers, as well as new offspring not containing 32P. 
3. **Other primary consumers**: The 32P activity in other primary consumers starts at 0 and rises slowly and gradually, reaching a much later peak (around week 6-8), then declining slowly. This suggests they also feed on the treated plants, but perhaps to a lesser extent, or have alternative food sources. The delayed and lower peak implies a slower accumulation of 32P compared to Species X. 
4. **Secondary consumers**: The 32P activity in secondary consumers starts at 0, rises very slowly, peaks very late (around week 10-12), and then declines very slowly. This pattern is characteristic of bioamplification (or biomagnification) where 32P accumulates in higher concentrations at higher trophic levels as they consume primary consumers containing the label. The very delayed and slow rise and decline are due to the time required for 32P to move through the food chain and accumulate."
"An investigation into feeding relationships in a forest community using radioactively labeled phosphorus (32P) is described. 32P phosphate ions were supplied to plants using stem wells. Figure 9.1 shows a vertical cross-section of a stem well. A 'plant stem' is inserted into the well, which contains a 'solution containing 32P labelled phosphate'. The top of the well is covered with a 'cover'. In the experiment, 200 such stem wells were used to supply 32P to plants for one week, after which the wells were removed. Tissue samples were taken from the plants and other community members at various intervals, and the activity of 32P phosphate ions per unit biomass was measured. Graph 9.2 presents the results, plotting 'activity of 32P phosphate ions per unit biomass / arbitrary units' on the y-axis against 'time/weeks' on the x-axis, from 0 to 12 weeks.

'Secondary consumers': Shows 32P activity starting at 0, rising very slowly, reaching a peak very late, around week 10-12, and then declining very slowly.Describe how processes that occur in a green leaf play a part in the carbon cycle.","Processes in a green leaf play a crucial role in the carbon cycle, primarily through photosynthesis and respiration. During photosynthesis, leaves absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Chlorophyll in the chloroplasts captures light energy to convert this carbon dioxide and water into glucose (an organic carbon compound) and oxygen. This glucose then becomes the basis of organic matter in the plant. When the plant respires, some of this glucose is broken down, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The glucose and other organic compounds in the plant are also passed on to consumers that feed on the plant. Furthermore, over long geological periods, the carbon in plant matter can be transformed into fossil fuels like coal, sequestering carbon from the atmosphere and contributing to the long-term carbon cycle."
"The problem introduces tyrosine kinase (TK), an enzyme in human cells existing in functional and non-functional forms. Figure 10.1 illustrates the activation of TK. The 'Non-functional form of TK' is depicted as an irregularly shaped molecule. When a 'Phosphate group' (small, triangular) is added to it, it transforms into the 'Functional form of TK'. This functional form shows the phosphate group attached, which results in a change in the enzyme's shape, creating a specific binding site for the 'Substrate of TK' (a larger, irregularly shaped molecule) to attach. Figure 10.2 shows the 'Faulty form of TK'. This form is depicted as an irregularly shaped molecule, similar to the functional form but without the phosphate group shown, and it is implied to be always active.Suggest how faulty TK leads to chronic myeloid leukaemia.","In chronic myeloid leukaemia, a faulty form of TK is produced (as shown in Figure 10.2). This faulty TK is intrinsically active, meaning it is 'always' or 'constantly active' even without the binding of a phosphate group for activation. Since the normal function of activated TK is often to signal for cell growth and division, a continuously active faulty TK leads to uncontrolled and excessive cell division. This uncontrolled proliferation of white blood cells is a hallmark of cancer, specifically leading to chronic myeloid leukaemia."

Figure 10.3 illustrates how Imatinib inhibits the faulty form of TK. The 'Faulty form of TK' is shown as an irregularly shaped molecule. 'Imatinib', a smaller molecule, binds to the faulty TK. The resulting complex shows Imatinib attached to the faulty TK, implying that Imatinib alters the faulty enzyme's conformation or blocks its active site. A graph with axes labeled 'rate of reaction/arbitrary units' (y-axis) and 'time/minutes' (x-axis) is provided. A curve already exists, labeled 'without Imatinib', showing the reaction rate increasing over time and then leveling off at a high plateau.Explain how Imatinib can be used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia.","Imatinib is used to treat chronic myeloid leukaemia by specifically inhibiting the faulty form of tyrosine kinase (TK). As shown in Figure 10.3, Imatinib binds to the faulty TK molecule. This binding causes a change in the shape of the faulty enzyme's active site, or it blocks the active site directly. Consequently, the substrate of TK can no longer bind efficiently to the enzyme, or the number of functional enzyme-substrate complexes decreases. This reduces the rate of the TK-mediated reaction, which is typically involved in signaling cell division. By suppressing the constant activity of the faulty TK, Imatinib effectively halts or significantly slows down the uncontrolled proliferation of cells characteristic of leukaemia, thus treating the disease."
"No visual elements are provided for this question. David enters the forest wearing only shorts and a sleeveless shirt when the air temperature is below 10 °C. His body will respond to maintain homeostasis.David enters the forest wearing only shorts and a sleeveless shirt when the air temperature is below 10 °C. Explain, with reference to the principles of homeostasis, how his body will respond.","When David enters the forest in cold conditions (below 10 °C) with minimal clothing, his body temperature will start to drop. This decrease in skin temperature acts as a stimulus, which is detected by thermoreceptors located in his skin. These receptors then send nerve impulses to the hypothalamus, the body's regulatory center for temperature control. In response to the cold, the hypothalamus initiates several corrective mechanisms to increase heat production and reduce heat loss, maintaining core body temperature (homeostasis): 
1. **Vasoconstriction**: Arterioles in the skin constrict, reducing blood flow to the skin's surface. This minimizes heat loss from the blood to the external environment. 
2. **Shivering**: Skeletal muscles undergo rapid, involuntary contractions (shivering), which generates heat through metabolic activity. 
3. **Increased Metabolic Rate**: The body's overall metabolic rate increases, leading to more heat generation from internal chemical reactions. 
4. **Hair Erection (Piloerection)**: The erector pili muscles contract, causing hairs to stand on end. While less effective in humans, this attempts to trap a layer of insulating air close to the skin. 
These coordinated responses aim to raise David's body temperature back to the normal range, preventing hypothermia."
No visual elements are provided for this question. David spots a hungry bear standing five meters in front of him and his heart beats faster.David spots a hungry bear standing five meters in front of him and his heart beats faster. Describe the nervous pathway that resulted in his response.,"When David spots a hungry bear, the following nervous pathway leads to his increased heart rate: 
1. **Sensory Input**: Light rays reflected from the bear enter David's eyes. The lens focuses these diverging light rays sharply onto the retina. Photoreceptors (rods and cones) in the retina are stimulated by the visual input. 
2. **Neural Transmission to Brain**: Nerve impulses are generated and transmitted via sensory neurons in the optic nerve to the brain. 
3. **Brain Processing**: The brain interprets these impulses as the image of a bear and perceives the threat. 
4. **Response Coordination**: The brain, specifically the hypothalamus and other fear centers, coordinates an appropriate 'fight or flight' response. 
5. **Transmission to Adrenal Glands**: Nerve impulses are transmitted down relay neurons in the spinal cord and then through motor neurons, across synapses, to the adrenal glands located above the kidneys. 
6. **Hormone Release**: The adrenal glands are stimulated to secrete adrenaline (epinephrine) into the bloodstream. 
7. **Physiological Effect**: Adrenaline travels through the blood and acts on target organs, including the heart, causing its rate and force of contraction to increase, leading to David's heart beating faster."
"The diagram shows part of a leaf in cross-section. Structure X points to a xylem vessel, a long, hollow tube responsible for water transport, forming part of the vascular tissue. Structure Y points to a phloem vessel, responsible for transporting sugars, also forming part of the vascular tissue. Both X and Y are located within the vascular bundles of the leaf.Structures X and Y are both part of the same A cell. B organ. C tissue. D vessel.","Structure X is a xylem vessel and structure Y is a phloem vessel. Both xylem and phloem are types of vessels found within plants, forming part of the vascular system. Therefore, X and Y are both part of the same type of structure, which is a vessel. The correct option is D."
"The diagram illustrates a plant root in the soil, actively absorbing water. Point A is located inside the cytoplasm of a root hair cell. Point B is within a cortical cell, which is an inner cell layer of the root. Point C is inside a xylem vessel, a transport tube in the center of the root. Point D is in the soil, directly adjacent to a soil particle and outside the root hair cell. Water moves from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. For a plant to absorb water, the water potential in the soil must be the highest, followed by the root cells, and then the xylem.The diagram shows part of a plant root in the soil. The root is absorbing water. At which labelled point is the water potential highest? A B C D","Water moves from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. For the root to absorb water from the soil, the water potential must be highest in the soil surrounding the root, which is indicated by point D. Water potential then progressively decreases as water moves into the root hair cell (A), across the cortex (B), and into the xylem (C). Therefore, point D, in the soil, has the highest water potential."
"No visual context. The question asks for the definition of active transport. Active transport is a process that moves molecules across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient, which requires energy expenditure by the cell.Which statement describes active transport? A the movement of ions through a cell membrane, releasing energy B the movement of ions through a cell membrane, using energy C the movement of water through a cell membrane, releasing energy D the movement of water through a cell membrane, using energy","Active transport is defined as the movement of substances, such as ions, across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient, a process which requires the cell to expend energy. Option A incorrectly states that energy is released, and options C and D refer to water movement, which is osmosis (a form of passive transport, not active transport, and does not require energy use for movement itself). Therefore, statement B, 'the movement of ions through a cell membrane, using energy,' correctly describes active transport."
No visual context. The question asks for an example of assimilation. Assimilation is the process by which absorbed nutrients are converted into the components of the organism's body or used for energy.What is an example of assimilation? A absorption of glycerol into lacteals B breakdown of alcohol in the liver C building of proteins from amino acids D release of a hormone from a gland,"Assimilation refers to the process where absorbed nutrients are incorporated into the body's cells and used for growth, repair, or energy. Option A, absorption, is the transport of nutrients into the bloodstream/lymph, which precedes assimilation. Option B, breakdown of alcohol, is metabolism but not assimilation in the context of building body components. Option D, hormone release, is secretion. Option C, 'building of proteins from amino acids,' is a classic example of assimilation, as amino acids are absorbed and then used by cells to synthesize new proteins for the body."
"No visual context. The question states that the small intestines of cows are similar to humans'. A disease reduces the number of villi in a cow's small intestines, leading to weight loss and weakness. Villi are small, finger-like projections in the small intestine that significantly increase the surface area for absorption of digested nutrients.The small intestines of cows are similar in general structure and function to the small intestines of humans. A disease in cows reduces the number of villi in their small intestines. The cows lose weight and become weak. What explains this? A less amylase produced B less peristalsis C less absorption of nutrients D slower digestion of proteins","Villi are crucial for efficient absorption of digested nutrients in the small intestine because they greatly increase the surface area. A reduction in the number of villi (C) directly leads to a decrease in the surface area available for absorption. Consequently, fewer nutrients can be absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to malnutrition, weight loss, and weakness despite adequate digestion. Options A and D relate to digestion, not absorption directly, and option B, less peristalsis, affects movement of food, not primarily absorption surface area."
"The graph illustrates how the rate of photosynthesis changes with light intensity at two different temperatures: 25°C (curve P) and 15°C (curve R). The x-axis represents light intensity, and the y-axis represents the rate of photosynthesis. At low light intensities (represented by sections Q and S, which are on the initial rising portions of the curves), the rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to light intensity. At higher light intensities (represented by sections P and R, which are plateaued parts of the curves), the rate of photosynthesis no longer increases with increasing light intensity, indicating that another factor is limiting the rate. When light intensity is limiting, an increase in light intensity will cause an increase in the rate of photosynthesis.The graph shows how the rate of photosynthesis varies with light intensity and temperatures. Other variables are kept the same. In which sections of the graph is light intensity limiting the rate of photosynthesis? A P and R B Q and S C R and Q D S and P","Light intensity is a limiting factor when an increase in light intensity directly causes an increase in the rate of photosynthesis. This corresponds to the initial, rising parts of the photosynthesis rate curves, where the graph is sloping upwards. In the provided graph, sections Q (on the 25°C curve) and S (on the 15°C curve) are both in these rising regions. Sections P and R represent plateaued regions where the rate no longer increases with light intensity, meaning another factor (like temperature or CO2) is limiting. Therefore, light intensity is limiting in sections Q and S, making B the correct answer."
"The table provides information about blood vessels in the human body, including the origin of blood, its destination, and its oxygenation status (oxygenated or deoxygenated). The specific vessels listed are the aorta, pulmonary vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic portal vein. P, Q, R, and S are blanks to be filled. For the aorta, which carries oxygenated blood to all organs (except lungs), its origin P should be the left ventricle. For the pulmonary vein, which carries blood from the lungs to the heart, this blood is oxygenated after gas exchange in the lungs, so Q should be 'oxygenated.' For the hepatic artery, which carries oxygenated blood from the aorta, its destination R should be the liver. For the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the alimentary canal to the liver, this blood has already supplied oxygen to the gut and absorbed nutrients, so it is deoxygenated, and S should be 'deoxygenated.'What are P, Q, R and S? A P: left ventricle, Q: deoxygenated, R: kidney, S: deoxygenated B P: left ventricle, Q: oxygenated, R: liver, S: deoxygenated C P: right ventricle, Q: deoxygenated, R: kidney, S: oxygenated D P: right ventricle, Q: oxygenated, R: liver, S: oxygenated","1. The aorta carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The chamber of the heart that pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta is the left ventricle. So, P is 'left ventricle.' 2. The pulmonary vein carries blood from the lungs to the heart. After gas exchange in the lungs, the blood becomes oxygenated. So, Q is 'oxygenated.' 3. The hepatic artery supplies oxygenated blood to the liver from the aorta. So, R is 'liver.' 4. The hepatic portal vein carries blood from the alimentary canal (digestive tract) to the liver. This blood has already delivered oxygen to the gut tissues and picked up absorbed nutrients, so it is deoxygenated. So, S is 'deoxygenated.' Matching these to the options, the correct combination is P: left ventricle, Q: oxygenated, R: liver, S: deoxygenated, which corresponds to option B."
"No visual context. The question asks which features of the human breathing system help maintain the carbon dioxide gradient between the alveoli and the outside air. A steep carbon dioxide gradient is essential for the efficient diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the alveoli and then out of the body.In the human breathing system, which features maintain the carbon dioxide gradient between the alveoli and the outside air? 1 blood continually pumped to the alveoli 2 breathing in and out- 3 moist alveolar surfaces. 4 thin alveolar walls A 1 and 2 B 1 and 4 C 2 and 3 D 3 and 4","To maintain a steep carbon dioxide gradient, two key aspects are crucial: 1. **Breathing in and out (2):** This process, also known as ventilation, continuously refreshes the air in the alveoli, removing carbon dioxide-rich air and bringing in fresh air with a lower carbon dioxide concentration. This ensures a low partial pressure of CO2 in the alveoli, maintaining a steep gradient with the blood. 2. **Moist alveolar surfaces (3):** Carbon dioxide, like other respiratory gases, must first dissolve in a thin film of moisture on the alveolar surface before it can diffuse across the alveolar and capillary walls. Without moist surfaces, CO2 cannot dissolve and diffuse effectively, which would lead to its accumulation in the alveoli, thereby reducing and failing to maintain the concentration gradient. While blood flow (1) and thin walls (4) are also vital for efficient gas exchange, options 2 and 3 directly contribute to creating and sustaining the functional gradient for CO2 removal. Therefore, 2 and 3 are the correct features, corresponding to option C."
"No visual context. The question asks what can be an effector in a reflex arc. A reflex arc is a neural pathway that mediates a reflex action. It typically involves a receptor, a sensory neuron, an interneuron, a motor neuron, and an effector. The effector is the component that carries out the response to the stimulus.Which of the following can be an effector in a reflex arc? A a gland B a light receptor C the brain D the spinal cord","In a reflex arc, the effector is the organ or cell that responds to a nerve impulse from a motor neuron, producing the final action. Examples of effectors include muscles (which contract) and glands (which secrete substances). A light receptor (B) is a receptor, detecting stimuli. The brain (C) and spinal cord (D) are parts of the central nervous system, involved in processing and transmitting signals, but are not effectors themselves in the typical sense of producing the final output. Therefore, a gland (A) can be an effector in a reflex arc, for example, causing the secretion of saliva in response to food."
No visual context. The question states that opticians use chemicals to keep the pupil wide open (dilated). The pupil is the opening in the center of the iris that controls the amount of light entering the eye. Its size is controlled by two sets of muscles in the iris: circular muscles (which constrict the pupil when they contract) and radial muscles (which dilate the pupil when they contract).Opticians sometimes place drops of a chemical in a patient's eye to keep the pupil wide open. Which muscles contract when this chemical is used? A ciliary muscles B circular muscles C muscles that move the eyeball D radial muscles,"To keep the pupil wide open (dilate it), the radial muscles of the iris must contract. Contraction of the radial muscles pulls the iris outwards, increasing the pupil's diameter. Conversely, the contraction of circular muscles constricts the pupil. Ciliary muscles (A) are involved in accommodation (changing lens shape), not pupil size. Muscles that move the eyeball (C) are extrinsic eye muscles, separate from pupil control. Therefore, option D, radial muscles, is the correct answer."
"No visual context. The question asks what among the options may be heterozygous. Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles for a particular gene (e.g., Aa).Which of these may be heterozygous? A a haploid cell B an allele of a gene C an organism with a dominant phenotype D an organism with a recessive genotype","1. A haploid cell (like a gamete) contains only one set of chromosomes and therefore only one allele for each gene; it cannot be heterozygous. 2. An allele is a variant form of a gene itself, not a state of combination (heterozygous or homozygous). 3. An organism exhibiting a dominant phenotype can either be homozygous dominant (e.g., AA) or heterozygous (e.g., Aa). Both genotypes result in the dominant phenotype. Therefore, an organism with a dominant phenotype *may* be heterozygous. 4. An organism with a recessive phenotype *must* have a homozygous recessive genotype (e.g., aa) to express the recessive trait. It cannot be heterozygous. Thus, only an organism with a dominant phenotype (C) may be heterozygous."
"The diagram illustrates a key step in genetic engineering. It shows a circular plasmid, which is a small, extra-chromosomal DNA molecule found in bacteria, commonly used as a vector. It also shows a 'section of DNA cut and removed' that is being inserted into the plasmid at a site labeled P. The overall goal of this process is to enable a bacterium to produce human insulin.The diagram shows a bacterium whose plasmid is being used during genetic engineering to produce human insulin. What is inserted at P so that the bacterium can produce human insulin, and which enzyme is used to catalyse the insertion? A a section of human DNA, using DNA ligase B a section of human DNA, using restriction enzymes C a section of human mRNA, using DNA ligase D a section of human mRNA, using restriction enzymes","In genetic engineering for human insulin production in bacteria: 1. The gene for human insulin, which is a segment of DNA, needs to be inserted into the bacterial plasmid. So, 'a section of human DNA' is inserted at P. 2. The insertion of this DNA segment into the cut plasmid requires the formation of phosphodiester bonds to join the DNA fragments. This ligation (joining) process is catalyzed by the enzyme DNA ligase. Restriction enzymes are used to *cut* the DNA and plasmid at specific sites, not to insert. Therefore, a section of human DNA is inserted using DNA ligase, which corresponds to option A."
"The diagram displays four different types of ecological pyramids. Pyramid 1 is upright, with the largest trophic level at the base and decreasing size upwards. Pyramid 2 is inverted, with the smallest trophic level at the base and increasing size upwards. Pyramid 3 is spindle-shaped, with a narrow base, a wider middle level, and a narrower top. Pyramid 4 is another inverted pyramid, showing a very small base and a significantly larger trophic level above it. The food chain described is: Tree (producer) → insect larvae (primary consumer) → birds (secondary consumer) → parasitic fleas (tertiary consumer/parasite).A tree has insect larvae burrowing in its leaves. The emerging insects are eaten by birds and the birds have parasitic fleas living amongst their feathers. Which is a pyramid of biomass and which is a pyramid of numbers for this food chain? pyramid of biomass | pyramid of numbers A 1 | 3 B 1 | 4 C 2 | 4 D 2 | 3","1. **Pyramid of Biomass:** In a terrestrial food chain starting with a large producer like a tree, the biomass generally decreases at each successive trophic level. A single tree has a large biomass, followed by a smaller total biomass of insect larvae, then an even smaller total biomass of birds, and finally a very small total biomass of parasitic fleas. This pattern results in an upright pyramid of biomass, best represented by **Pyramid 1**. 2. **Pyramid of Numbers:** For this food chain, the numbers pyramid would be: one tree (producer) supports many insect larvae (primary consumers). These many larvae support fewer individual birds (secondary consumers). However, each bird can host many parasitic fleas (tertiary consumers). This results in a pyramid that is narrow at the base (one tree), widens for the larvae, narrows for the birds, and then widens again for the fleas. This irregular or spindle shape is best represented by **Pyramid 3**. Therefore, the correct match is Pyramid 1 for biomass and Pyramid 3 for numbers, corresponding to option A."
"The table asks to match examples to four ecological terms: community, ecosystem, population, and trophic level. A community refers to all the different populations of organisms living and interacting in a particular area. An ecosystem includes all the living organisms (community) in an area, as well as the non-living physical environment. A population refers to all the individuals of a single species in a given area. A trophic level describes the position an organism occupies in a food chain.What is the correct match of example to ecological term? community | ecosystem | population | trophic level A all lake organisms | freshwater lake | freshwater shrimps | pond weed as primary producer B freshwater shrimps | all lake organisms | pond weed as primary producer | freshwater lake C freshwater lake | pond weed as primary producer | freshwater shrimps | all lake organisms D freshwater shrimps | freshwater lake | all lake organisms | pond weed as primary producer","Let's analyze each component of Option A: 'all lake organisms' correctly describes a community (all living species in an area). 'freshwater lake' correctly describes an ecosystem (community plus abiotic environment). 'freshwater shrimps' correctly describes a population (all individuals of one species). 'pond weed as primary producer' correctly identifies a trophic level (producers). Since all parts of option A are correctly matched, it is the correct answer."
